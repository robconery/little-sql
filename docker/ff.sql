INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('1','Lamar Jackson','Ravens','QB','296.0','465.0','3425.0','25.0','10.0','156.0','902.0','6.0','The 2019 NFL MVP is fresh off a breakout season in which he outscored the next-closest quarterback by 78 fantasy points despite resting in Week 17. The dual-threat weapon threw 36 touchdowns to only six interceptions while adding a record-setting 176-1,206-7 rushing line -- that rushing production alone would''ve ranked 28th among running backs. The question is: Can he do it again? History says no, as his 9.0% TD rate (highest the NFL has seen over the past decade) is unsustainable, and the last quarterback to repeat as the top-scoring fantasy QB was Daunte Culpepper in 2004. On the other hand, Jackson''s rushing volume and prowess give him an extremely high floor, as shown by his 11 top-six fantasy weeks in 15 outings last season. Jackson''s unique style makes him an elite fantasy weapon and worth a look early in Round 3.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('2','Patrick Mahomes','Chiefs','QB','364.0','557.0','4465.0','32.0','10.0','61.0','280.0','3.0','Patrick Mahomes is 24 years old and has 36 NFL starts under his belt yet has already been named both league and Super Bowl MVP. So where does he go from here? Well, considering he still has Andy Reid''s pass-heavy scheme, a strong offensive line and a terrific group of targets led by Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce at his disposal, we should probably expect more of the same. Granted, Mahomes returned to earth a bit last season (4,031 passing yards, 28 total TDs) after his breakout 2018 campaign (5,097 yards, 52 TDs), but he was still unquestionably one of the best players in the league. Mahomes was fantasy''s No. 3 scoring QB during the 13 weeks he played in full, and that doesn''t even count his 12 touchdowns in three playoff games. Mahomes remains an elite fantasy option.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('3','Deshaun Watson','Texans','QB','337.0','517.0','4018.0','27.0','12.0','87.0','519.0','4.0','Watson enters his fourth NFL season fresh off back-to-back fourth-place finishes in fantasy. The 24-year-old has emerged as one of the game''s best players, ranking no lower than eighth in completion percentage and 13th in yards per attempt in each of the past two seasons. Watson has yet to clear 26 passing touchdowns in a season, but he makes up a ton of ground with his legs, ranking top-four in rushing attempts, yards and touchdowns in each of the past two seasons. The elephant in the room is the loss of top weapon DeAndre Hopkins, though it''s worth noting that Watson has averaged a strong 9.2 YPA to wide receivers other than Hopkins in his career. Watson remains a solid fantasy starter.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('4','Dak Prescott','Cowboys','QB','350.0','543.0','4280.0','27.0','11.0','49.0','248.0','4.0','Prescott will be back under center for Dallas following his best professional season in 2019. Prescott ranked no lower than sixth among quarterbacks in pass attempts (596), completions (388), passing yardage (4,902), passing touchdowns (30), yards per pass attempt (8.2) and average depth of throw (9.4) -- all while dealing with a league-high 30 drops. Also a factor as a rusher (52-277-3), Prescott finished a career-best second at the position in fantasy points. Armed with a terrific line, as well as WRs Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup and CeeDee Lamb, Prescott should be considered a solid QB1 option.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('5','Russell Wilson','Seahawks','QB','300.0','473.0','3692.0','29.0','9.0','73.0','397.0','2.0','The 2019 season was a tale of two halves for Wilson. He was the top-scoring fantasy QB through Week 6 but was held to three top-12 weeks and the 11th-most points the rest of the season. At the end of the day, he had his eighth top-11 fantasy campaign in as many tries, which includes four top-three seasons since 2014. Wilson remains a force with his legs (he''s ranked no lower than ninth among QBs in rushing yards in his career), but he''s also ranked top-three in passing touchdowns (33.3 per season) in each of the past three seasons. With Tyler Lockett, second-year receiver DK Metcalf and newcomer Greg Olsen at his disposal, the 31-year-old Wilson remains a solid QB1.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('6','Kyler Murray','Cardinals','QB','349.0','544.0','3819.0','26.0','12.0','87.0','469.0','3.0','Murray''s rookie season had its ups and downs, which is exactly what you''d expect from a first-year starting quarterback. The 2019 first overall pick struggled to 6.9 YPA and took a league-high 48 sacks, but he also finished strong by leading the Arizona offense to three-plus touchdowns in eight of the team''s final 11 games. Murray''s rushing ability helped him to a 93-544-4 rushing line (top-four in all three categories) and an eighth-place finish in fantasy points. Murray was already a strong bet for a second-year leap, but the addition of DeAndre Hopkins further adds to his appeal. The hype might lead to an irresponsible ADP, but there''s little doubt Murray has elite upside. He''s a solid fantasy starter.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('7','Tom Brady','Buccaneers','QB','361.0','575.0','4455.0','31.0','9.0','24.0','27.0','2.0','In case you were living under a rock during the offseason, Tom Brady is now on the Buccaneers. The 43-year-old hasn''t been much of a fantasy force in recent seasons, having finished 12th or worse among QBs in fantasy points in three of the past four seasons and four of the past seven. He''s also coming off arguably his worst professional season (24 pass TDs, 61% completion rate, 6.6 YPA). Of course, there''s plenty of reason to expect a bounce-back in Tampa, as his top targets go from Julian Edelman, James White and Mohamed Sanu to Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and old friend Rob Gronkowski. Brady adds very little with his legs but avoids turnovers and figures to push the ball downfield more in Bruce Arians'' high-volume, pass-first attack. Consider the GOAT a back-end QB1.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('8','Matt Ryan','Falcons','QB','390.0','600.0','4533.0','28.0','12.0','32.0','125.0','1.0','Ryan''s bizarre roller-coaster career continued in 2019, as his 11th-place fantasy campaign means he has finished outside the top 10 QBs in fantasy points during odd years and no lower than seventh in even years, going all the way back to 2012. In Ryan''s defense, he missed a game (his first since 2009) and still played well, ranking top-nine in completion percentage for the eighth consecutive season. Ryan also paced all QBs in completions (408) and finished top-six in passing yards for the 10th straight season. Operating in Dirk Koetter''s high-volume offense with Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, Todd Gurley and five first-round picks on the offensive line, Ryan has a high floor and is a fringe QB1.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('9','Matthew Stafford','Lions','QB','344.0','539.0','4213.0','27.0','11.0','33.0','123.0','1.0','Stafford missed half of the 2019 season due to injury, but don''t let that overshadow what was otherwise a very strong campaign. The Lions'' offense scored 21 touchdowns during his eight starts (2.6 per game; 1.8 per game in the other eight), and Stafford finished 62.5% (five of eight) of his starts as a top-10 fantasy QB, which was the position''s fourth-best rate. Powered by a league-high 10.8 aDOT (average depth of target), Stafford''s career-high 8.6 YPA was second best in the league. Prior to last season, the 32-year-old had not missed a game since 2010, and he is well-positioned behind a solid line and with Kenny Golladay, Marvin Jones Jr. and second-year TE T.J. Hockenson as his primary weapons. Consider Stafford a strong QB2.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('10','Carson Wentz','Eagles','QB','337.0','527.0','3801.0','27.0','9.0','54.0','213.0','2.0','Despite his wide receiver room being absolutely ravaged by injuries, Wentz posted his second career top-10 fantasy campaign in 2019. Volume was the primary reason, as the 27-year-old ranked first in snaps, fifth in pass attempts and seventh in carries among QBs. Wentz dealt with 24 drops (third most) and got very little after the catch for the fourth consecutive season (4.8 RAC). Perhaps most important, Wentz held up, handling 99% of the Eagles'' dropbacks before a concussion suffered in the playoffs. Wentz will work behind an elite offensive line and with a solid group of weapons in 2020. He''s a back-end QB1.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('11','Drew Brees','Saints','QB','363.0','518.0','4011.0','30.0','9.0','20.0','11.0','1.0','Brees missed six games due to injury last season and also ceded occasional snaps to Taysom Hill. The future Hall of Famer was still fantasy''s No. 2 scoring QB during the 10 weeks he was active, producing 28 touchdowns and only three interceptions. Brees continues to win with elite efficiency, having paced the NFL in completion percentage in each of the past three seasons while ranking no lower than 10th in YPA during that span. Brees'' supporting cast is arguably better this season, with Emmanuel Sanders added to a group that includes Michael Thomas, Jared Cook, Alvin Kamara and a quality line. Now 41, Brees is a back-end QB1.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('12','Josh Allen','Bills','QB','291.0','483.0','3414.0','18.0','11.0','96.0','545.0','5.0','Allen is the perfect example of why rushing is so important when it comes to QB fantasy evaluations. The 2018 first-round pick finished as fantasy''s No. 6 QB last season despite ranking 23rd in passing yards, 21st with only 20 passing TDs, third worst in completion percentage (59%) and 11th worst in YPA (6.7). Of course, Allen also produced a 109-510-9 rushing line and has now paced the position in rushing TDs in each of his two NFL seasons (17 total). Allen''s passing troubles remain a red flag, but the addition of Stefon Diggs should help his cause. As long as he keeps running, Allen will be a back-end QB1 option.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('13','Aaron Rodgers','Packers','QB','333.0','528.0','3820.0','26.0','8.0','43.0','206.0','1.0','Once a perennial top-two fantasy QB, Rodgers has settled in as more of a mid-to-back-end QB1 in recent seasons. That included 2019, which saw him finish ninth in fantasy points even though he appeared in all 16 games and ranked eighth in pass attempts. Rodgers'' efficiency has been a culprit, as he hasn''t finished better than 16th in YPA since 2014 after previously dominating the category. He also hasn''t cleared 26 pass TDs in a season since 2016 and is no longer much of a factor with his legs. Rodgers has Davante Adams, Aaron Jones and a solid line at his disposal, but the 36-year-old is no longer an elite fantasy weapon.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('14','Daniel Jones','Giants','QB','339.0','536.0','3718.0','25.0','13.0','52.0','267.0','2.0','Jones was in and out of the lineup during his rookie campaign, but the 2019 sixth overall pick certainly made an impact when on the field. During 12 starts, Jones paced all rookie QBs with 24 pass TDs and was fifth in fantasy points. Jones'' efficiency wasn''t good (62% completion rate, 6.6 YPA), but inconsistency is common for rookie passers. Despite the Giants'' top targets playing zero games together due to injury, the New York offense ranked 13th in touchdowns during Jones'' rookie campaign. Jones is armed with a solid supporting cast and adds value with his legs (he ranked seventh in rushing yards as a rookie). Consider him a fringe top-12 QB and a breakout candidate.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('15','Jared Goff','Rams','QB','369.0','578.0','4280.0','22.0','13.0','31.0','64.0','2.0','The Rams'' offense took a step back last season, but heavy volume allowed Goff to make occasional noise in fantasy. Goff finished top-five in pass attempts, completions and yards, which helped him to seven top-10 fantasy weeks (fifth most). The 2016 first overall pick has finished 12th, seventh and 13th in fantasy points during Sean McVay''s three seasons. He adds very little with his legs (40 rushing yards last season) but still manages to hang in as a streaming option thanks to McVay. In 2020, Goff will have a strong group of targets led by Robert Woods, Tyler Higbee and Cooper Kupp, though the Rams'' line remains a concern. Consider Goff a midrange QB2.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('16','Ben Roethlisberger','Steelers','QB','339.0','529.0','3867.0','25.0','12.0','27.0','73.0','1.0','Roethlisberger is back in Pittsburgh after missing all but two games due to injury last season. The last time we saw Roethlisberger for a full season, the Steelers'' offense set a franchise record with 51 touchdowns in 2018. Roethlisberger paced the NFL in dropbacks (712), attempts (675) and completions (452), while finishing top-five in passing yards (5,086), passing touchdowns (34) and fantasy points (342) that season. The 38-year-old finished eighth or better in fantasy points per game in five straight seasons prior to 2019. Roethlisberger adds little with his legs, but he has a good line, an intriguing WR trio led by JuJu Smith-Schuster, and newcomer TE Eric Ebron in the fold. Consider Big Ben a top-15 option with QB1 upside.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('17','Ryan Tannehill','Titans','QB','296.0','447.0','3491.0','23.0','11.0','58.0','206.0','2.0','Tannehill signed a four-year extension with Tennessee following an impressive bounce-back 2019 campaign in which he completed 70% of his passes (third best) and posted 9.6 YPA (first). Tennessee scored three-plus touchdowns in 12 of Tannehill''s 13 starts, which helped the 31-year-old to the third-most fantasy points among quarterbacks from Week 7 on. Tannehill has been around since 2012, but he has finished only one season as a top-15 fantasy QB and is a strong bet for statistical regression to the mean. With the Titans'' extremely run-heavy offense also in mind, the veteran passer is best viewed as a solid QB2.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('18','Baker Mayfield','Browns','QB','314.0','501.0','3656.0','25.0','15.0','33.0','130.0','2.0','Mayfield was one of 2019''s biggest busts, with preseason concerns related to interceptions, a lack of rushing production and shaky offensive tackles all proving problematic when push came to shove. The 2018 first overall pick appeared in all 16 of Cleveland''s games and was 10th in pass attempts, but he managed only 25 total touchdowns to go along with 21 interceptions (second most), 40 sacks (seventh) and 141 rushing yards (20th). Mayfield was fantasy''s No. 20 scoring QB and managed only two weekly finishes better than ninth. A supporting cast led by Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, Nick Chubb, Kareem Hunt and Austin Hooper is a positive, as is the arrival of new coach Kevin Stefanski. Mayfield is a fine post-hype sleeper but shouldn''t be counted on as a starter just yet.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('19','Jimmy Garoppolo','49ers','QB','314.0','467.0','3704.0','25.0','13.0','45.0','74.0','2.0','The 49ers were the best team in the NFC last season, but that did not lead to much fantasy relevance for Garoppolo. Appearing in more than six games in a single season for the first time in his career, Garoppolo finished 14th in fantasy points and was held to four top-10 weeks (18 QBs had more). Garoppolo tossed 27 touchdowns (fifth most) and was efficient (69% completion rate, 8.4 YPA), but he lacked opportunity in San Francisco''s run-heavy offense (he finished 19th in pass attempts) and added very little with his legs (46-62-1 rushing line). Garoppolo has a good supporting cast led by George Kittle, Deebo Samuel and a great line, but the 28-year-old figures to cap out as a QB2 in Kyle Shanahan''s run-heavy scheme.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('20','Joe Burrow','Bengals','QB','328.0','527.0','3687.0','20.0','13.0','54.0','258.0','2.0','The Bengals selected Burrow with the No. 1 pick of April''s draft. Burrow doesn''t have the strongest arm, but he is extremely accurate and has good size (6-foot-3, 221 pounds), playmaking ability and mobility. The LSU product completed 76% of his passes, registered as off target on 7.7% of his throws and posted a 94.9 total QBR during the 2019 season, all of which were best in this year''s rookie class. Burrow also adds value with his legs (368 rushing yards, 5 TDs), which only adds to his fantasy upside. Burrow will be a Week 1 starter, but as is the norm for rookie passers, he''s a long shot to reach QB1 status in 2020.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('21','Kirk Cousins','Vikings','QB','335.0','495.0','3739.0','21.0','9.0','33.0','93.0','2.0','Cousins may be conservative, but there''s no denying he was one of the league''s most effective passers last season. The eight-year vet completed 69% of his passes (top-5 for the second consecutive season) and posted an 8.1 YPA (seventh best). Despite the efficiency, Cousins was not a good fantasy QB. Minnesota''s run-heavy offense was problematic, as he posted one weekly finish better than sixth and was outside the top 20 in eight of 15 starts. Cousins hasn''t used his legs as often in Minnesota as he did in Washington, which has been a factor in his 12th- and 15th-place finishes among QBs in fantasy during the past two seasons. Especially with Stefon Diggs gone, Cousins is a mid-to-back-end QB2.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('22','Philip Rivers','Colts','QB','335.0','517.0','3834.0','26.0','15.0','16.0','30.0','0.0','Rivers is now the starter in Indianapolis, following 16 seasons with the Chargers. Rivers joins the Colts following a 2019 campaign in which he did some things well (66% C%, 7.8 YPA) but struggled elsewhere (20 INTs, 48.6 QBR). Rivers hasn''t finished a season better than eighth in fantasy points since 2013 and has one top-10 during the span. He offers almost zero with his legs (34 yards and zero TDs the past three seasons). Relative to last season in LA, Rivers'' primary targets in Indianapolis won''t be quite as good, but his offensive line will be substantially better. Though Rivers is an upgrade for the Colts, he is still unlikely to provide consistent QB1 numbers. He''s worth a look only in 2QB leagues.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('23','Gardner Minshew II','Jaguars','QB','321.0','510.0','3616.0','19.0','9.0','56.0','288.0','1.0','Minshew''s ascent was one of the league''s best stories of 2019, as the Washington State star quickly emerged from sixth-round draft pick to the Jaguars'' starting quarterback. Minshew appeared in 14 games and tossed 21 touchdowns to only six interceptions. The efficiency wasn''t great (61 C%, 7.0 YPA, 19% off-target rate), but Minshew made up some ground with his legs, ranking fifth among QBs with 344 rushing yards. Following the Nick Foles trade to Chicago, Minshew is allbut locked in as the 2020 Jaguars'' starter. New offensive coordinator Jay Gruden''s resume, combined with Jacksonville''s shaky defense, suggests Minshew will be throwing plenty. That''s enough to make him a QB2 and deep sleeper.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('24','Drew Lock','Broncos','QB','315.0','494.0','3534.0','21.0','11.0','51.0','221.0','1.0','The Denver defense is in excellent shape behind defensive-minded coach Vic Fangio, so the pressure will be on the second-year Lock to get this team back to the playoffs. The 2019 second-round pick failed to make much noise in five starts as a rookie, averaging a weak 6.5 YPA and managing only one weekly fantasy finish better than 20th. Denver is expected to continue leaning on a run-first offense, though Lock''s supporting cast is looking much better after the team added Melvin Gordon, Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler to a group that already included Courtland Sutton, Noah Fant and Phillip Lindsay. Not a huge factor as a rusher, Lock figures to be limited to mid-to-back-end QB2 production, though he''s an obvious deep sleeper in his second season.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('25','Sam Darnold','Jets','QB','321.0','522.0','3650.0','22.0','14.0','42.0','108.0','2.0','Darnold''s career is off to a slow start, with the USC product having missed three games due to injury/illness during each of his two seasons. He has a total of 39 touchdowns to go along with 28 INTs, and his 60% completion rate and 6.9 YPA are both well below average. Darnold hasn''t been afraid to push the ball down the field (8.9 aDOT), but he adds little with his legs and has made little fantasy impact. The 2018 third overall pick posted four top-10 fantasy weeks but was 20th or worse in eight of his other nine outings last season. With an improved line and Chris Herndon back, Darnold''s supporting cast is better in 2020, but he''ll need a giant leap in order to come close to the QB1 discussion.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('26','Cam Newton','Patriots','QB','266.0','428.0','2946.0','18.0','10.0','71.0','360.0','3.0','Newton signed with the Patriots following nine seasons in Carolina. The dual-threat quarterback was playing some of the best ball of his career in 2018, but that campaign was cut short by a late-season shoulder injury and a foot injury derailed his 2019 campaign. Newton attempted only 89 passes and ran the ball five times in two games prior to being shut down for the season. Now that he''s 31 years old, it''s fair to wonder whether he can still be a factor with his legs and, if not, can he make up for it with his arm? Even missing two games in 2018, Newton finished top five at the position in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns for the eighth consecutive season, so it''s very possible he has something left in the tank. He''s worth a late-round flier, as he''ll be back on the QB1 radar if he beats out Jarrett Stidham.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('27','Dwayne Haskins Jr.','FA','QB','323.0','519.0','3726.0','18.0','14.0','42.0','188.0','1.0','The 15th-overall pick of the 2019 draft, Haskins appeared in nine games as a rookie and is expected to open the 2020 season as Washington''s starting QB. The word ''expected'' is notable here, as his job security is tenuous after new coach Ron Rivera traded for Kyle Allen '' his 2019 starter in Carolina. Haskins will also need to up his game after ranking among the league''s worst in completion percentage (59%), off-target rate (22%), and YPA (6.7) on 203 rookie-season attempts. Haskins failed to finish a week better than 10th in fantasy points, and it''s hard to expect much improvement in 2020 with an unproven group of targets behind Terry McLaurin and with minimal contributions from his legs.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('28','Derek Carr','Raiders','QB','305.0','457.0','3389.0','20.0','9.0','25.0','70.0','1.0','Carr played better last season than you probably realize, but once again it didn''t lead to much fantasy success. Granted, he was very conservative (6.6 aDOT), but Carr completed 70% of his passes (second highest) and posted a 7.9 YPA (ninth) all while dealing with 24 drops (third most). That efficiency helped him to only one top-10 fantasy week prior to a pair of eighth-place showings when it mattered the least during Weeks 16-17. Carr has never posted a top-10 fantasy campaign in six NFL seasons and has finished 16th or worse each of the past three seasons. The Raiders'' offense simply hasn''t scored enough to overcome Carr''s conservatism and low-end rushing production. Rookie additions Henry Ruggs III, Lynn Bowden and Bryan Edwards will help, but Carr remains a fringe QB2.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('29','Teddy Bridgewater','Panthers','QB','323.0','503.0','3610.0','17.0','10.0','44.0','75.0','1.0','Bridgewater will replace Cam Newton as Carolina''s starter following a pair of seasons as Drew Brees'' backup. Bridgewater has barely seen the field since 2015 but was forced into extended action in six games last season. He showed fairly well, tossing nine TDs to two INTs while completing 68% of his passes (sixth best). Bridgewater was very conservative '' his 6.1 aDOT was easily lowest in the league, but he still managed the 11th-most fantasy points during that span. Bridgewater will work with innovative rookie head coach Matt Rhule and has a decent group of weapons led by DJ Moore, Curtis Samuel, Robby Anderson and Christian McCaffrey. Bridgewater''s conservative game and minimal rushing contributions (31 rushing yards last season) limit him to fringe QB2 territory.');

A dominant player during his time at Alabama, Tagovailoa very well could''ve been selected first overall if not for durability concerns, especially after last season''s serious hip injury. Tagovailoa is on the small side (6-foot, 217 pounds) but is a terrific decision-maker with excellent pocket presence and accuracy. His 2019 numbers were outstanding, with his 206.9 QB rating best in class and his 94.8 total QBR just behind Burrow''s. Tagovailoa has QB1 upside down the road, but he might open his career behind Ryan Fitzpatrick and is unlikely to land on the fantasy radar in a rebuilding Miami offense.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('31','Justin Herbert','Chargers','QB','265.0','421.0','3069.0','16.0','11.0','40.0','157.0','1.0','The Chargers found their heir to Philip Rivers when they selected Herbert with the sixth pick of April''s draft. Herbert is one of the biggest quarterbacks in this year''s rookie class, at 6-foot-6, 236 pounds. Herbert, who has drawn comparisons to Ryan Tannehill and Carson Wentz, figures to add some slight value with his legs. He''ll enter his first training camp behind veteran Tyrod Taylor, but it will be a surprise if he''s not under center before midseason. Herbert will enjoy a decent supporting cast (Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, Hunter Henry, Austin Ekeler), but he is a long shot for rookie-season fantasy value and doesn''t need to be drafted in most formats.');

Though Foles has flashed at times, he''s never played more than 13 games in a single regular season and has finished only one season better than 29th in fantasy points. Incredibly, Foles has registered exactly two weekly fantasy finishes better than 12th over the past four seasons. That includes a 2019 season in which he had only 117 attempts in Jacksonville due to injury and a later benching. Foles is a non-factor with his legs and may not even open the season as the starter. He''s well off the fantasy radar.');
INSERT INTO quarterbacks VALUES('33','Mitchell Trubisky','Bears','QB','140.0','221.0','1542.0','8.0','5.0','20.0','110.0','1.0','Trubisky is technically atop the Bears'' depth chart, but he is no longer assured of Week 1 starting duties following the team''s acquisition of Nick Foles. The second overall pick in 2017, Trubisky took a step forward in his second pro season back in 2018 but regressed in nearly every category last season. Despite appearing in 15 games, Trubisky was limited to only three top-10 fantasy weeks and finished 26th in points by season''s end. The 25-year-old is barely worth QB2 consideration as a starter, so with Foles lingering, he''s obviously well off the fantasy radar.');

The 30-year-old dual-threat quarterback has attempted only 91 passes over the past two seasons after losing starting gigs in both Buffalo and Cleveland. Taylor has never appeared in a full 16-game regular season, and his best fantasy finish was a ninth in 2016. His game is built on minimizing turnovers (18 INTs on 1,327 attempts since 2015) and rushing (top-3 at QB in rushing yards each season from 2015 to ''17), though it doesn''t lead to much passing production (he''s never cleared 3,035 yards or 20 TDs through the air).

That certainly applied to Fitzpatrick, who finished strongly with the third-most fantasy points among QBs during Weeks 12-17. In fact, the combination of Miami''s pass-first scheme and Fitzpatrick''s rushing production (54-243-4) allowed him the fourth-most fantasy points during the 13 weeks he played a bulk of the snaps. That all being said, Fitzpatrick is 37 years old, will still need to deal with a shaky offensive line and has appeared in 16 games once over the past seven seasons. Fitzpatrick may open the season as Miami''s starter, but it won''t be long before fifth-overall pick Tua Tagovailoa takes over. Fitzgerald doesn''t need to be drafted.');

McCaffrey paced the position in snaps, touches, yards, touchdowns, OTD, targets, receptions and carries inside the 5.

Of course, Elliott''s role still allowed him a top-3 finish in touches, yards and fantasy points.

Barkley, who missed three games because of injury, was on the field for 84% of New York''s snaps -- about the same as his rookie season (83%) -- when active. His 16.7 carries per game were up slightly from 2018 (16.3), though his targets inexplicably fell from 7.4 to 5.5 per game. Barkley still managed the third-most fantasy points among RBs during his 12 full weeks.

Kamara ended the season with a YPC above 4.5 and exactly 81 catches for the third consecutive season. A lack of usage near the goal line (7.1 OTD, 6 TDs) limited his fantasy production, though he did finish strongly with four of those scores coming during Weeks 16-17. Kamara should have little trouble pushing for 20 touches per game in the Saints'' Drew Brees-led, high-scoring offense. He remains a solid RB1.');

He handled 66% of the team''s carries (15.4 per game) and 14% of the targets (4.4) during that span. That heavy usage allowed him the fourth-most fantasy points among RBs during that span.

His heavy recent workload is a concern, but the good news is that he''s 25 years old and had not cleared 215 carries in a season prior to 2019. Henry''s minimal workload as a receiver (career-high 18 receptions last season) will continue to limit his fantasy output, so coupled with a probable dip in rushing production, he should be valued as a back-end RB1.');

Jones posted more duds than you''d expect from a top fantasy back (five weekly finishes outside the top 30), but still managed the second-most points at the position. Jones is a near lock for major touchdown regression this season, as his 19 TDs were nearly double his 10.8 OTD.

Sanders didn''t play more than 53% of the snaps in a game until Week 11, but he finished 15th among backs in fantasy points. The 23-year-old is primed for a larger share of the workload behind the Eagles'' elite offensive line in 2020. Consider him a strong RB2 with upside for more.');

Ekeler took his game to a new level last season, especially as a receiver, ranking no lower than second among backs in targets, receptions, yards and touchdowns. Despite Gordon playing a substantial role in 12 games, Ekeler was fantasy''s No. 4 scoring back. Ekeler''s small frame will limit his carries and goal-line work (he''s never cleared 132 carries or three rushing touchdowns in a season), and he''s unlikely to repeat a 91-992-8 receiving line with Tyrod Taylor and Justin Herbert under center. Expect a step back for Ekeler, though his role can still allow borderline RB1 production in PPR.');

He ranks first in YPC (5.1) and second in YAC (2.3) among 25 backs with at least 300 carries during that span. Chubb was fantasy''s No. 8 scoring back in 2019, thanks to the fourth-most touches and second-most total yardage at the position. However, we can''t ignore that Chubb''s usage and fantasy production dipped once Kareem Hunt returned from suspension (RB6 before, RB15 after). Hunt will be in the mix from the get-go in 2020, which will certainly limit Chubb''s output. Consider Chubb a borderline top-10 RB with more value in non-PPR leagues.');

The 2019 first-round pick averaged a healthy 4.75 YPC on 242 attempts and ranked fourth among backs with a 2.25 YAC. Jacobs flashed with four top-10 fantasy weeks but missed three games because of injury, and his output was capped by a limited role as a receiver (27 targets). Coach Jon Gruden has consistently expressed a desire to target Jacobs more often, which adds some optimism that Jacobs can become a workhorse back. Of course, until that actually happens, the 22-year-old is best valued as a fringe top-12 fantasy back.');

The role has allowed Mixon a top-seven finish in touches, top-11 finish in yards and eight-plus touchdowns each of the past two seasons. Despite the heavy usage, a limited role as a pass-catcher has left Mixon with fantasy finishes of 10th and 13th during that span. Mixon is one of the game''s better talents at the position, but the Cincinnati offensive line remains a work in progress and his target share is unlikely to see a significant boost with A.J.

The 2017 seventh-round pick has missed a total of three games over the past two seasons but finished fifth in rushing yards during both campaigns. Carson has been of value near the goal line (18 touchdowns) and in terms of efficiency (2.26 YAC is fourth best) during that span. Seattle ramped up Carson''s passing-game workload last season, which gives him a better shot at his third-consecutive top-15 fantasy campaign, but the 25-year-old will need to fend off Rashaad Penny and rookie DeeJay Dallas for snaps. Consider Carson a fine RB2 target.');

The Georgia product was a top-three fantasy RB in both 2017 and 2018, but he handled a lesser workload and struggled badly with efficiency in 2019 while dealing with knee and ankle concerns. After averaging 4.89 YPC (2.11 YAC) on 256 carries and 7.4 yards per target on 78 targets in 14 games in 2018, Gurley''s numbers plummeted to 3.84 YPC (1.81 YAC) on 223 carries and 4.2 YPT on 49 targets in 15 games last season. Gurley still managed a 14th-place finish in fantasy points (his fifth top-15 in as many tries), thanks to 14 touchdowns. Gurley''s durability is a big concern, but he has little competition for touches in a good offense. He''s a fine RB2 target.');

The 28-year-old is well-positioned for a rebound campaign with passing-down specialist Duke Johnson as his only competition for touches. The question is: Is he up for it? Johnson averaged an ugly 3.6 YPC and 1.4 YAC during the past three seasons. He remains an effective receiver but figures to focus primarily on rushing the ball with Duke Johnson in the picture.

During 15 active weeks, Fournette played 88% of the snaps, handling 87% of the carries and 19% of the targets. Fournette finished no lower than seventh among backs in carries, targets, receptions, touches, yards and fantasy points. Fournette''s season would''ve been even more impressive had it not been for some atrocious touchdown luck. Despite a healthy 9.3 OTD (10th highest), Fournette scored three touchdowns.

Bell''s first season in New York saw him rank no lower than 11th among backs in carries, targets, receptions and receiving yards. However, Bell ended up just 16th among backs in fantasy points, due to a low touchdown total (four) and horrific efficiency (3.2 YPC, 5.9 YPT). Bell''s heavy volume allowed him a high floor (double-digit points all but one week), but he no longer has an elite ceiling (one weekly finish better than ninth). Bell is now 28 years old and hasn''t appeared in 16 regular-season games since 2014. He''s no longer an RB1, though an improved Jets offensive line helps his 2020 prospects.');

Gordon is fresh off a season when he held out for a month before posting 162-612-8 rushing and 42-296-1 receiving lines. That was enough for the 12th-most fantasy points during that span. Gordon entered 2019 having finished the previous three seasons no lower than ninth in scrimmage yards, sixth in touchdowns and eighth in fantasy points among backs. In Denver''s run-heavy offense, Gordon figures to share a chunk of the carries with Phillip Lindsay, but his bigger frame should garner him more goal-line work, and he''s also the superior receiver.

Edwards-Helaire also paced this year''s rookie class in targets (65), receptions (55) and receiving yards (453) last season. He has three-down upside, though it''s possible his frame could cost him goal-line touches. Edwards-Helaire''s short-term production might be limited by the presence of Damien Williams, but it''s only a matter of time until he''s the feature back in the Chiefs'' high-scoring, Patrick Mahomes-led offense.

He returned in Week 10 last season and played a substantial role from that point on. Hunt was on the field for 60% of the snaps, handling 5.4 carries and 5.5 targets per game. Hunt was fantasy''s No. 17 RB during the stretch and trailed Chubb by only three fantasy points during that span. Chubb will continue to handle most of the carries and goal-line work, but Hunt''s role allows him standalone value, not to mention that he''s arguably the most valuable handcuff in fantasy.');

Despite missing three games in 2018, Conner broke out with 1,462 yards and 13 TDs on 269 touches en route to finishing sixth among running backs in fantasy points. He sat ninth at the position through Week 8 last season, but injuries limited him to 54 snaps the rest of the season. A return to full health by Conner and Ben Roethlisberger very well could lead to a bounce-back campaign for the 25-year-old, though he''ll need to fend off Benny Snell Jr., Jaylen Samuels and rookie Anthony McFarland Jr. for touches.

Swift was terrific in Georgia''s pro-style offense, producing as both a rusher (440 carries) and receiver (73 receptions) during his three seasons. His efficiency was more solid than spectacular, and he lacks some explosiveness, but he makes up for it with reliability, decent speed (4.48 40-yard dash), quickness and pass-catching prowess. Swift has three-down upside but will begin his career competing for reps with Kerryon Johnson, who figures to focus primarily on ball-carrying, with Swift busier in passing situations. That''s likely to limit Swift''s fantasy output, but he certainly could flirt with RB2 numbers and is worth a midround pick.');

During Weeks 8-16, Singletary handled a generous 14.9 carries and 4.0 targets per game. He was held to three touchdowns but was ninth among RBs in scrimmage yards, while playing 74% of the snaps during that span. Though he struggled after contact, Singletary''s 5.1 YPC was sixth best among backs. Singletary is expected to work as the lead back again this season, but his 5-foot-7, 203-pound frame will limit his volume. Expect rookie Zack Moss to be heavily involved, along with Josh Allen, at the goal line.

An outstanding prospect purely from a rushing standpoint, the Wisconsin product paced this year''s rookie class in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns and ranked fourth with a 3.7 YAC in 2019. Taylor also crushed it at February''s combine, running a position-best 4.39 40 and a solid 7.01 three cone despite a hefty 5-foot-10, 226-pound frame. The main concerns here are fumbles (18) and pass-catching ability (nine drops on 68 targets). Taylor has RB1 upside down the road, but his short-term fantasy value will suffer with incumbent early-down back Marlon Mack and passing-down specialist Nyheim Hines in the fold.

Believe it or not, Cohen ranks fourth among backs in both targets (261) and receptions (203) since entering the NFL in 2017. Cohen''s 190-pound frame has limited him to no more than 99 carries in a single season and a grand total of four carries inside the 5-yard line. However, 70-plus catches each of the past two seasons has helped him to fantasy finishes of 11th in 2018 and 27th in 2019. Cohen''s efficiency was extremely poor last season (3.3 YPC, 4.4 YPT), and he''ll remain limited as a rusher and at the goal line, but his role isn''t expected to change in 2020, which locks him into the PPR flex discussion.');

The Iowa State product wasn''t short on volume in his first season, ranking 12th among backs in touches and sixth in carries inside the 5 (14). The problem was a combination of poor rushing efficiency (3.7 YPC, 1.6 YAC) and a lack of volume and effectiveness as a pass-catcher (185 yards on 37 targets). The end result was two top-15 fantasy weeks and a 24th-place finish by season''s end. Montgomery will continue to defer passing-down work to Tarik Cohen but is certainly a breakout candidate in his second season. Montgomery is a flex option with RB2 upside.');

Ingram ranked 22nd in touches and 15th in scrimmage yards, but his 15 touchdowns ranked fourth. An injury-plagued 2018 season aside, Ingram has been a top-15 fantasy RB each season since 2014. Despite the positivity, it will be hard to count on a repeat from Ingram in 2020. He''s now 30, which means his volume is unlikely to rise (especially with J.K.

Vaughn is more fast (4.51 40-yard dash) than quick and is a tough 5-foot-10, 214 pounds. He has the size and ability to quickly contribute as a rusher, as a receiver and at the goal line. He''ll compete with Ronald Jones for carries and Dare Ogunbowale for targets right away in the new-look Buccaneers'' offense.

Despite his second-round pedigree and superior play relative to his counterparts in the Tampa Bay backfield, Jones was limited to only 37% of the snaps and 47% of the designed runs. It''s very possible we''ve yet to see the best of Jones, as he was drafted very young and is entering his age-23 season.

Howard is obviously a very effective rusher but has struggled as a receiver, averaging an ugly 5.4 yards per play on 119 career targets. A top-20 fantasy back during his first three seasons, Howard might struggle to get back to that territory as he operates as an early-down and goal-line complement to Matt Breida in Miami.

An extremely efficient runner, Mostert is averaging 6.0 YPC on 178 regular-season carries for his career, which is easily best among 188 RBs with 150-plus carries. The concerns here are that Mostert plays a minimal pass-catching role (22 targets last season) and Kyle Shanahan is very unpredictable with his backfield rotation.

White is a strong bet to remain New England''s primary passing-down back, but we can''t assume Cam Newton or Jarrett Stidham will target him as often, and the safe bet would be to expect less scoring and a more run-heavy approach from the Patriots'' offense.

It''s not often you get immediate production from an undrafted player, but Lindsay has produced a pair of 1,000-yard rushing seasons since Denver signed him after the 2018 draft. Lindsay has certainly flashed as a rusher (4.9 career YPC), but he has struggled to produce after contact (1.6 YAC) and as a receiver (4.5 YPT), which explains the team''s interest in Gordon.

Despite lacking some big-play ability and having to do most of his damage after contact last season (5.0 YPC, 1.7 YBC), Akers posted one of the best YAC/forced missed tackle profiles in this year''s rookie class. The Florida State product will open his career in a wide-open competition with second-year back Darrell Henderson and Malcolm Brown to replace Todd Gurley.

The Rams selected Henderson in the third round of the 2019 draft after he averaged 8.9 YPC (seriously!) on 344 carries during his final two seasons at Memphis. Henderson has tremendous upside as a rusher, and his passing-down chops make him a candidate for weekly PPR value, but he''ll be hard-pressed to separate himself from rookie Cam Akers (and perhaps Malcolm Brown) as the team''s clear feature back.

Hines'' receiving efficiency has been a problem (career 5.3 YPT and nine drops), and his 190-pound frame hasn''t allowed him much volume or efficiency as a rusher (3.7 YPC on 137 career carries) or in the scoring department (six career TDs).

However, he can be considered a lock for a reduced role after the team drafted Jonathan Taylor in the second round. That''s a problem for a player who, despite reaching 900 rushing yards and eight touchdowns each of the past two seasons, has still yet to post a top-20 fantasy campaign. There are two primary culprits: injuries (he has missed at least two games in each of his three NFL seasons) and a minimal workload as a receiver (31 total catches during the past two seasons). Mack may catch a few extra passes with Philip Rivers in town, but Taylor and Nyheim Hines will be major factors. Mack benefits from the Colts'' elite offensive line but may struggle for flex value in his new situation.');

Coleman returns to San Francisco in 2020 but simply can''t be counted on as a reliable starter. On one hand, it''s a good situation, as 49ers'' backs led the NFL in rushing yards (2,051) and touchdowns (19) last season. On the other hand, Jimmy Garoppolo didn''t target the position much (20th in the category), and job security is almost nonexistent in Kyle Shanahan''s offense. Coleman will compete with Mostert and Jerick McKinnon for snaps. Consider him a bench option with handcuff appeal.');

Thus far, Michel has essentially been limited to a situational, between-the-tackles hammer role. In 29 regular-season games, he has played 37% of the snaps and handled 54% of the carries (15.7 per game) and 3% of the targets (1.1 per game). That usage allowed Michel only two top-20 fantasy weeks in 2019. Perhaps New England will lean more on its 2018 first-round pick with Brady gone, but with his nonexistent role as a receiver and with James White, Rex Burkhead and Damien Harris in the fold, Michel should be viewed as only a flex option in non-PPR leagues.');

His 5.0 YPC in that span ranks third among 42 backs with 300-plus carries. Breida hasn''t done much after contact (1.5 YAC) or as a receiver (91 career targets) but has shown to be an explosive playmaker, which makes the 190-pound back a terrific complement to the 230-pound Howard.

Moss joins Devin Singletary in the Bills'' backfield.

In 13 full games last season, Williams was well behind Aaron Jones in carries (179 to 107) but was basically even in targets (46 to 45). Jones was a top-five fantasy RB in those 13 weeks, though it might surprise you to know that Williams was 24th. There are plenty of fantasy points to be had in the Packers'' backfield, but Williams, who has yet to post a top-30 fantasy campaign, might not even be the team''s lead back if Jones gets injured.

The Memphis product is big (6-foot, 228 pounds) and a terrific athlete with excellent power, speed (4.39 40-yard dash) and elusiveness. He''s a terror with the ball in his hands, having averaged 8.4 yards per carry and 13.1 yards per target (11.9 RAC) in 2019. Experience is a concern here (33 carries and 66 targets in two FBS seasons), but the shaky wide receiver depth chart behind Terry McLaurin suggests Gibson will, at least, get plenty of work as a pass catcher.

In terms of production, Evans followed a very efficient 2018 campaign with a boost in volume but a dip in efficiency in 2019. His forced missed tackle/YAC profile was poor this past season, but his combination of speed, ball protection (two career fumbles) and receiving ability suggests he''ll be a fine complementary back.

Penny''s 5.26 YPC ranks third, and his 2.05 YAC ranks 11th among 52 RBs with 150 carries since he entered the league. Penny forced his way into an expanded role and appeared on the verge of a breakout with rushing lines of 14-129-1 and 15-74-1 during Weeks 12 and 13 last season, but a Week 14 injury ended his season prematurely.

Incredibly, Thomas finished as a top-five fantasy WR nine times during his final 12 games of 2019. During his four NFL campaigns, Thomas has finished no lower than ninth in receptions, yards, catch rate and fantasy points. Thomas'' massive 32.5% target share will be hard to repeat, but history suggests he''ll still be in the vicinity.

A top-five fantasy WR in four of the past five seasons, Hopkins has averaged 10.5 targets per game during that span, which is a mark he should still be able to approach with Arizona. Murray is far from a finished product, but the Cardinals'' offense finished 2019 strong with three-plus touchdowns in eight of their final 11 games -- and that was without one of the game''s best receivers.

He finished fourth at the position in catch rate (72%) and RAC (6.6) and was first in first-down rate (50%).

He finished as a top-five WR in 42% of those outings, which trailed only Michael Thomas. The only concern here is durability as Adams has missed at least one regular-season game due to injury in each of the past three seasons, including four 2019 absences.

That may not seem ideal after Evans put together four consecutive seasons as a top-17 fantasy WR, but it''s very possible that the 26-year-old''s efficiency and consistency will actually improve with Tom Brady in town. Evans has ranked near the top of the league in aDOT and YPR throughout his career, but near the basement in both catch rate and RAC. That has led to inconsistent production, including 2019, when 53% of his fantasy point total for the season came during just three games. Even if the big plays are down a bit, Evans will see enough volume and goal-line work (he''s never finished lower than ninth in end-zone targets) to reach his third top-10 fantasy campaign.');

Moore''s efficiency has been outstanding, as he has dropped just three of 215 career targets, while dominating with the ball in his hands (5.7 RAC). The one drawback has been a lack of scoring (six career TDs, 8.2 OTD), which has limited his ceiling. He managed only two weekly finishes better than 13th and was fantasy''s No. 16 WR in 2019.

Incredibly, Cooper has yet to finish a season higher than 10th in fantasy points but, in five seasons, he has managed to post four 1,000-yard seasons and three seasons in a row with seven-plus TDs. He also has finished among the top receivers in catch rate and YPT for the past two seasons.

Sutton was terrific after the catch (5.0 RAC), reliable (only two drops on 124 targets), and productive despite some bad touchdown luck (6 TD, 7.2 OTD). Since entering the league, Sutton ranks sixth in the NFL with 23 end-zone targets.

His five top-10 outings for the season trailed only Michael Thomas for the league high. Brown then crashed back to earth in the playoffs with a mere 64 yards in three games. The inconsistency was frustrating, but Brown appears to be the real deal. His 12.5 YPT and 9.0 RAC both topped the position and he dropped only one of his 84 targets.

He ended up as fantasy''s No. 11 WR and finished top five in routes run, receiving yards and touchdowns. The 27-year-old has first-round pedigree and had suffered through several injuries, so the leap wasn''t a major shock, but we also should proceed with caution in 2020.

Gallup looks like the real deal following a breakout second season in which he posted a 66-1,107-6 receiving line and ranked ninth among wide receivers with a 16.8 YPR. The 24-year-old has solidified himself as one of Dak Prescott''s go-to targets and, even though his workload could drop slightly with CeeDee Lamb in the mix, he could make up for some of that with more usage near the goal line.

When Jones was out during Weeks 15-17, Golladay only edged Amendola 23-20 (24%-21%) in that category. This trio is probably closer than you realize in usage, which may lead to Jones being undervalued in fantasy again.

Shepard replaced Odell Beckham Jr. as the Giants'' No. 1 WR last season -- and he was very busy, handling six-plus targets during all 10 appearances. Only five other players can say the same. Shepard''s efficiency was poor, but the volume allowed him the 17th-most fantasy points during those 10 weeks.

Brown ended up as the WR46 on the season, thanks to seven touchdowns on 69 targets. His 10.1% TD rate was second highest at the position and certainly unsustainable.

Crowder finished near the basement of the position in aDOT (8.1) for the fifth time in as many seasons, which limited big plays (6.8 YPT), but allowed him to soak up receptions (16th most). At 5-foot-8, 185 pounds, Crowder won''t get you many touchdowns. Heck, he has only 20 career end zone targets.

That figures to lead to a decrease in production for Diggs, which is a concern considering he was only the WR24 last season -- despite Kirk Cousins'' extremely efficient campaign and with Adam Thielen sidelined.

Despite all of the success, Edelman''s stock is on the decline following Tom Brady''s departure. The Patriots'' offense is a strong bet for a decrease in passing volume and efficiency and, if that weren''t bad enough, Edelman is now 34 and has managed only three career 16-game seasons.

That success came despite his operating in an offense with extremely poor quarterback play. That''s unlikely to be an issue again in 2020 with Ben Roethlisberger back from injury. Johnson joins up with JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington and rookie Chase Claypool to form one of the league''s top young WR groups.

However, he didn''t see much work near the goal line (only four end-zone targets) and his 6.8 YPT ranked near the basement of the league. Moving forward, Kirk is a near lock for a big reduction in targets with superstar DeAndre Hopkins now sitting atop the depth chart.

Tate was the WR28 in fantasy from Week 5 on and sported a very high floor, producing eight top-30 weeks in 11 outings. That 73% rate was fifth best at WR. Tate is entering his age-32 season, but remains elite with the ball in his hands. He has ranked at least 12th in RAC in each of the past seven seasons. Tate won''t score often (career-high 5.7 OTD), but he''ll be one of Daniel Jones'' go-to targets in 2020. Consider the veteran as a PPR flex option.');

Williams struggled with drops (4) and off-target throws (his 25% rate was 13th highest), but was still a respectable WR37 in fantasy prior to the injury. The 23-year-old was out-targeting DeVante Parker as a rookie and it''s possible he overtakes the veteran again this season. Consider Williams for your flex spot.');

At 26, Cooks is still in his prime, but has already been traded three times. Despite the constant movement, he has finished four of the past five seasons as a top-15 fantasy WR. Primarily a vertical threat, Cooks ranked no lower than ninth in YPT in the three seasons prior to an injury-plagued 2019 campaign with the Rams. Concussions are an ongoing concern for Cooks, but, if healthy, he''s in good shape as one of Deshaun Watson''s top targets.

The 5-foot-11, 188-pound playmaker has great hands, ball skills and is exceptional after the catch. The Alabama product was limited to 55 targets in 2019, but his 13.6 YPT and 10.5 RAC were both top four in this year''s rookie class. Ruggs figures to operate as a perimeter lid-lifter and returner in the pros, which would be good news in the explosive-play department, but it could cap his target upside. That said, the Raiders have such a severe need at wideout that Ruggs is very likely to step right into an every-down role.

Anderson went undrafted in 2016, but went on to appear in 62 of 64 games with New York, hauling in 206 passes for 3,034 yards and 20 touchdowns. Anderson was limited to one strong fantasy campaign (18th in 2017) and finished 39th and 40th in the past two seasons. In Anderson''s defense, a position-high 33% of balls thrown his direction were ''off target'' last season. In Carolina, the 26-year-old vertical threat will work alongside DJ Moore and Curtis Samuel in Matt Rhule''s new-look offense led by QB Teddy Bridgewater. Consistency is unlikely with Christian McCaffrey as the focal point of the Panthers'' offense, so Anderson is safest as a borderline flex play in deeper leagues.');

From Weeks 10-17, the Clemson product played on 82% of the 49ers'' snaps. Powered by 697 yards and four touchdowns, he was fantasy''s No. 9 scoring WR. He kept it up in the playoffs with 229 yards on 16 touches. Samuel was primarily used near the line of scrimmage, posting one of the position''s lowest aDOTs (7.7), but also the fifth-best catch rate (71%), the seventh-best YPT (10.0) and the second-best RAC (8.1). A weapon as both a receiver and rusher, Samuel shouldn''t struggle for touches in Kyle Shanahan''s offense once he returns from a leg injury.

Sanders is no longer the target hog he was during his prime, but he has nonetheless managed a pair of top-30 fantasy campaigns over the past two seasons. Sanders has seen top-10 finishes in catch rate in both of the past two seasons and figures to work as one of Drew Brees'' top targets in the short-to-intermediate area behind Michael Thomas. Sanders is unlikely to be a major asset near the goal line, as he has cleared six touchdowns in a season just once in his career.

Slayton was on the field for 77% of the Giants'' pass plays and was WR27 in fantasy points from Week 3 on. Slayton''s touchdown rate is far from sustainable (3.5 OTD), but the 2019 fifth-round pick will enter his second season as New York''s primary vertical threat. The New York offense has a lot of mouths to feed, but there''s certainly a window for Slayton to become the team''s No. 1 wideout. Slayton is safest as a flex in deeper leagues.');

The problem, of course, is that Fuller is entering his fifth NFL season having already missed 34% of his team''s games because of injury. That number includes five games last season. The good news is that, when healthy, Fuller has been heavily targeted and productive. In nine full games last season, he handled 7.7 targets per game (a 25% share) and trailed Hopkins by only nine total targets. He was fantasy''s No. 13 WR in those weeks. It''s hard to expect a full season from the oft-injured receiver, but Fuller undoubtedly still has massive upside. The 26-year-old is best viewed as a flex.');

Brown handled a generous 26% target share during 15 regular-season games and finished 20th at wide receiver in fantasy points. Despite the strong output, Brown''s fantasy stock has taken a hit due to Buffalo''s trade for Stefon Diggs. With an expectation for reduced target share, a vertical role that limits consistency and receptions, and a run-heavy scheme, it''s hard to view Brown as a safe weekly starter.

His efficiency wasn''t good (51% catch rate, 5.9 YPT), although some of that can be blamed on a 28% off-target rate (eighth highest in the NFL). Samuel did finish as 2019''s No. 26 fantasy WR, thanks in part to his also being a factor as a rusher (19-130-1 on the ground). He is sure to sustain a significant role in Matt Rhule''s new-look offense, but Carolina''s signing of Robby Anderson is sure to cost Samuel targets.

Last season, Williams paced the NFL in aDOT (17.3) and YPR (20.4) and ranked fourth in YPT (11.0), but dealt with the worst luck in the league in the touchdown department. Williams posted a 6.9 OTD thanks to 11 end-zone targets (tied for eighth most), but scored only twice.

Perriman was a situational target in Tampa Bay for most of 2019, but with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin injured, he produced a 25-506-5 receiving line and was a WR3 in fantasy during Weeks 13-17. Perriman''s NFL resume includes more struggles than success, which makes him a risky investment, but he''s well-positioned for an every-down role with New York.

Hardman''s short-term outlook is a bit cloudy with both Sammy Watkins and Demarcus Robinson returning, but Hardman is just one depth-chart adjustment or injury away from working as one of Patrick Mahomes'' primary targets.

Jeudy is fast (4.45 40-yard dash), agile and a quality route-runner. Jeudy slots in behind Courtland Sutton but has little competition for snaps otherwise and should be an every-down player out of the gate.

Harry is obviously a strong candidate for a great leap forward in his second season, especially with little competition for targets behind Julian Edelman. The big question mark here is quarterback play, as Cam Newton''s health and Jarrett Stidham''s ability are major unknowns.

Jefferson is 6-foot-1, 202 pounds with outstanding ball skills and contested-catch ability. The former LSU Tiger also has decent wheels (4.43 40), though he doesn''t stand out in terms of perimeter separation or against press, which helps explain why he aligned in the slot 90% of the time in 2019. With only Adam Thielen ahead of him on the depth chart, Jefferson won''t be short of playing time as a rookie, which isn''t new for the player who paced the FBS with 111 receptions in 2019.

Reagor was held to 6.6 YPT and a 47% catch rate last season, but a prospect-low 60% of his targets were charted as catchable (55 of 92). Quarterback play was obviously an issue, though Reagor did have problems of his own, with nine drops and six fumbles. Reagor (5-foot-11, 206 pounds) has 4.47 speed and can contribute as a receiver, returner and ball carrier.

Despite the promotion, expectations should be tempered. For starters, Reynolds'' efficiency hasn''t been great on his 120 career targets (51% catch rate, 6.9 YPT). Additionally, Sean McVay adjusted his scheme in the second half of last season, pivoting from using "11" personnel a league-high 90% of the time when passing during Weeks 1-13 to just 75% of the time (15th highest in the NFL) during the final month. That change led to reduced roles for the team''s secondary receivers and a larger role for TE Tyler Higbee.

The towering 6-foot-4, 225-pound receiver played a similar role early in 2018, but inefficient play and a change in scheme eventually led to a demotion. Funchess is positioned well for a rebound, as the Packers'' depth chart is wide open behind Davante Adams.

Now 24, Washington joins JuJu Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson and rookie Chase Claypool to form a formidable young foursome for a now-healthy Ben Roethlisberger.

Hill is fresh off a 2019 season, when he caught 57 passes and became Ohio State''s all-time receptions leader with 201. Primarily a slot receiver (93% in 2019), Hill averaged an ugly 8.7 yards per target but caught 76% of balls thrown his way during his four seasons. Hill (6-foot, 196 pounds) has good hands (10 drops on 269 career targets) and is quality route runner but lacks speed (4.60 40-yard dash) and post-catch prowess. Hill is a long shot for 2020 fantasy value after plummeting to the seventh round, but the Chargers'' depth chart is wide open behind Keenan Allen and Mike Williams. Monitor him in deep leagues.');

A lack of speed (4.61 40-yard dash) and strength (nine bench reps) are concerns, though he showed off his quickness with a wideout-best 4.12 short shuttle at the combine.

Is that good? It seems good. Kelce continued his dominance last season by finishing as a top-13 fantasy TE every week other than 17. Kelce has finished no lower than second at the position in routes, targets, receptions and yardage each of the past three seasons. His touchdowns fell from 10 in 2018 to five in 2019, but his 7.3 OTD (second-highest) and nine end zone targets (fourth) suggest he was actually unlucky in that area. Kelce has never finished a season outside the top 10 in YPT and remains one of Patrick Mahomes'' top targets. The 30-year-old is worth a look in Round 2.');

Kittle followed up his breakout 2018 season with an 85-1053-5 receiving line in 14 games in 2019. Kittle has finished no lower than fourth in targets, receptions, yardage, RAC or fantasy points each of the past two seasons. One area where Kittle has underwhelmed is touchdowns (five each of the past two seasons) and his 10.8 OTD and 13 end zone targets during the span suggest it''s not a fluke. Of course, there''s still plenty of room to grow in that department, and Kittle has plenty of dominant years left at age 26. He''s a fine third-round target.');

Ertz hasn''t finished lower than fifth in targets, sixth in receptions or seventh in yardage at the position since 2014. He''s also ranked no lower than fourth in touchdowns and OTD each of the past three seasons. Third-year Dallas Goedert is looming, but Ertz enters his age-29 season as Carson Wentz''s top target and remains a top-five fantasy tight end.');

It''s fair to say he delivered the goods in 2019. Despite ranking 40th at the position in snaps, Andrews handled a massive 25% target share for Baltimore''s league-best offense en route to a TE5 fantasy campaign. Andrews'' 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the entire league. That helped him to 10 touchdowns. Andrews'' has ranked no lower than fifth in aDOT or YPR during his two pro seasons. Lamar Jackson''s top target enters his age-24 season as a solid TE1 option.');

Waller was drafted in the sixth round of the 2015 draft as a 6-foot-6 wide receiver. He barely saw the field while dealing with addiction but got back on his feet as a tight end with the Raiders. An absolute force from the get-go, Waller finished no lower than fourth among tight ends in snaps, routes, targets, receptions, yardage or YPT. Waller was held to three touchdowns (3.9 OTD) but finished third in fantasy points. The 27-year-old is Derek Carr''s top target and positioned well for another high-volume season.

The injuries have held Engram without a top-12 fantasy campaign since 2017, but there''s no doubt he''s been a major force when healthy. Engram was one of six players who appeared in at least eight games and were targeted at least six times during 100% of those outings last season. The consistent usage helped him to five top-10 fantasy weeks in eight tries (the position''s fourth-best rate). We have to knock him a bit for durability concerns, but Engram is still in his prime at age 25 and should be locked into lineups when active.');

The 2016 fourth-round pick had totaled an 86-884-5 receiving line in 58 games through Week 12 of last season. He went on to produce a 43-522-2 line while averaging 11.4 targets per game the rest of the season. Higbee was the top-scoring fantasy TE by 23 points during the span. The 27-year-old signed a contract extension last year and Sean McVay''s adjustment to more ''12'' personnel late last season suggests Higbee''s emergence was no fluke. Higbee is best-viewed as mid-range TE1.');

Cook missed a pair of games last season, but managed a TE7 campaign thanks to nine touchdowns (his 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the league) and elite efficiency (he posted the position''s highest aDOT, YPR and YPT). Cook is now 33 years old, but his role as one of Drew Brees'' primary targets remains secure. Consider him a borderline top-10 fantasy option.');

The longtime Patriots'' superstar ended his retirement and was traded to the Buccaneers, where he''ll reunite with his former quarterback Tom Brady. Gronkowski sat out last season after ending 2018 with his seventh fantasy finish of 11th or better in nine NFL seasons. When healthy, effectiveness has never been an issue for Gronkowski (he has never played a season in which he was lower than seventh among tight ends in yards per target or yards per reception), but durability has been an issue (he hasn''t appeared in a full 16-game regular season since 2011).''Gronkowski is unlikely to re-emerge as an elite fantasy option, but he''s in a good enough situation to allow mid-to-back-end TE1 numbers.');

The team''s 2016 second-round pick has yet to play a full 16-game season, missing all of 2018 and a total of seven games the other three seasons. That includes four in 2019, though Henry was productive enough when active to produce his first top-10 fantasy campaign. Henry has finished top-10 in YPT in all three of his NFL seasons and has been a force near the goal line, with 17 touchdowns and 25 end zone targets in 41 games. Henry''s durability woes and the departure of Philip Rivers are concerns, but the 25-year-old will still be a back-end TE1 option when active.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('11','Hayden Hurst','Falcons','TE','54.0','623.0','4.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','Hurst was traded to the Falcons following two seasons as a situational player in Baltimore. Atlanta will look to the 2018 first-round pick as a replacement for Austin Hooper. Hurst posted a modest 30-349-2 receiving line off the bench last season, but his efficiency was great. He ranked sixth at tight end in both catch rate (77%) and YPT (8.9). Hurst has yet to eclipse a 58% snap share in 30 career games, but he figures to operate as a full-time, two-way tight end in a pass-heavy Atlanta offense that helped Hooper to back-to-back TE1 campaigns. Hurst is obviously a bit risky, but the 26-year-old is well-positioned for a breakout. Consider him a mid-range TE2.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('12','T.J. Hockenson','Lions','TE','54.0','621.0','4.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','It''s rare for a rookie tight end to make much noise in fantasy, so Hockenson''s 32-367-2 line after being selected eighth overall in the 2019 draft should not be viewed as a knock. The Iowa product showed his upside with a 6-131-1 showing in his NFL debut, but managed double-digit fantasy points in only one additional game and missed the final four games due to injury. The 23-year-old is a strong bet for more work in his second season and, as usual for second-year tight ends, will come fairly cheap in the double-digit rounds. Hockenson has the upside to become one of the next great all-around tight ends.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('13','Noah Fant','Broncos','TE','54.0','614.0','4.0','2.0','7.0','0.0','The Broncos selected Fant in the first round of last year''s draft and proceeded to put him on the field for 68% of their offensive snaps. That''s a healthy number for a 21-year-old rookie, as was Fant''s TE16 fantasy campaign. The Iowa product was a game-changer with the ball in his hands, pacing 41 qualified tight ends with an 8.3 RAC. His 562 receiving yards rank sixth and his 8.9 YPT fifth among rookie tight ends since 2007. Fant''s usage actually declined quite a bit in December, but there''s little doubt he''s a strong candidate for a big second-year leap as one of Drew Lock''s top targets. Fant has elite upside and should be on your radar in the middle rounds.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('14','Austin Hooper','Browns','TE','49.0','518.0','5.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','Hooper signed with the Browns during the offseason following four seasons with the Falcons. The 2016 third-round pick has finished no lower than seventh among tight ends in routes, targets, receptions or receiving yards each of the past two seasons. He posted career-high marks in targets (96), receptions (75), receiving yards (787) and touchdowns (six) last season despite missing three games and was fantasy''s top-scoring tight end prior to suffering an injury in Week 10. Hooper''s stock takes hit as he trades Matt Ryan and Atlanta''s pass-heavy offense for Baker Mayfield and a Browns offense that also include David Njoku. Hooper enters his age-25 season as a borderline top-10 fantasy option.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('15','Jack Doyle','Colts','TE','50.0','521.0','5.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','With Eric Ebron out of the picture, Doyle has regained his status as the Colts'' clear top tight end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like late last season as Doyle tied for the team lead with 31 targets (20% share) once Ebron went on IR after Week 12. Doyle was held to two top-10 fantasy weeks and one finish better than eighth on the season, but there are reasons for optimism. Coach Frank Reich''s tight end units have never combined for a target share below 23% in six seasons as a coach/OC. Also, new QB Philip Rivers made heavy usage of Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry in recent years with the Chargers. Doyle, who ranked sixth at tight end with eight end zone targets last season, should be viewed as a fringe top-15 fantasy TE in his age-30 season.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('16','Chris Herndon','Jets','TE','48.0','590.0','4.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','Herndon is back on the fantasy radar following an injury-plagued 2019 campaign in which he was limited to 16 snaps. The Jets selected Herndon in the fourth round of the 2018 draft and quickly put him in position for a big role. The Miami product was on the field for 63% of New York''s snaps and, following a slow start, was fantasy''s No. 9 tight end from Week 6 on. His 10.3 aDOT was fifth-highest at the position and helped him to a strong 9.0 YPT (10th). Herndon''s 502 receiving yards rank 12th, his catch rate 12th, his YPT fourth and his aDOT second among rookie tight ends since 2007. Herndon is an excellent post-hype target and positioned well for a breakout.');

The 2018 second-round pick finished the season third among tight ends in pass routes and ranked no lower than 12th in targets, receptions, receiving yards or touchdowns. Gesicki''s 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the entire league. His 58% catch rate was ugly, but his role as a seam-stretcher (10.1 aDOT) and shaky quarterback accuracy (22% off target rate) were the primary culprits. Gesicki has yet to drop a pass on 120 targets and was fantasy''s TE12 in 2019. He''s a candidate for another leap forward and a borderline TE1 option.');

The 2014 first-round pick underachieved during his time with the Lions, but a breakout season in 2018 saw him post a 66-750-13 receiving line. He crashed back to earth last season thanks to predictable regression to the mean, but also due to the loss of Andrew Luck, posting a 31-375-3 line in 11 games. Now with Pittsburgh, the 27-year-old figures to work ahead of Vance McDonald as the team''s top receiving tight end. Ebron is best-viewed as a mid-to-back-end TE2.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('19','Dallas Goedert','Eagles','TE','46.0','464.0','4.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','Goedert spent the 2019 season behind Zach Ertz on the depth chart and missed a game, but still managed a top-10 finish among tight ends in targets, receptions, yardage, touchdowns and fantasy points. A big reason for the high-end production was a massive number of injuries to Eagles'' wide receivers and that shows up in Goedert''s splits. The 2018 second-round pick posted five top-10 fantasy weeks, but four came after the team''s Week 10 bye. Goedert appears to have a bright future, but the 25-year-old will struggle for TE1 numbers barring an Ertz injury. Goedert is, however, one of the best handcuffs in fantasy.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('20','Jonnu Smith','Titans','TE','43.0','450.0','4.0','4.0','16.0','0.0','With Delanie Walker out of the way, Smith enters his fourth NFL season finally locked in atop the Titans'' depth chart. Granted it was on 43 targets, but Smith''s 2019 season was highly efficient. He ranked no lower than second at the position in catch rate (81%), YPT (10.2) or RAC (7.9). The Titans appear committed to manufacturing touches for the versatile Smith, as 19% of his targets came on screens and he also handled four carries. Of course, the usage has yet to allow much fantasy success. Most of Smith''s work has come near the line of scrimmage (5.7 aDOT) and very little has come near the end zone (eight touchdowns, six end zone targets in career). Smith is a back-end TE2.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('21','Blake Jarwin','Cowboys','TE','43.0','488.0','4.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','Jarwin enters his fourth NFL season as a relative unknown, but the 25-year-old is now atop the Dallas depth chart following Jason Witten''s departure. Jarwin has yet to post a top-25 fantasy campaign, but he showed what he can offer with a 7-119-3 receiving line in Week 17 of the 2018 season. He''s been efficient on 77 career targets, with a healthy 75% catch rate and 8.7 YPT. He''s unlikely to rise higher than fourth in line for targets, but Dallas'' high-scoring offense makes Jarwin worthy of a late-round flier.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('22','Irv Smith Jr.','Vikings','TE','46.0','484.0','3.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','Smith is entering his second NFL season after posting a 36-311-2 receiving line as a rookie. The 2019 second-round pick played a healthy 587 snaps, but was a clear second to Kyle Rudolph (749 snaps) on the depth chart and was primarily utilized as short-area target (5.9 aDOT). Rudolph out-targeted Smith 49 to 48, though Smith is a strong bet to take over as the team''s top receiving threat at the position in his second season. Smith is still extremely young (he''s entering his age-22 season), but especially with Stefon Diggs gone, he''s well-positioned for a step forward. Rudolph''s presence will limit his ceiling, but Smith is a fine TE2 target.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('23','Jimmy Graham','Bears','TE','42.0','497.0','3.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','Graham signed with the Bears during the offseason following a pair of seasons with the division-rival Packers. The 33-year-old isn''t the fantasy force he was during his prime years in New Orleans and Seattle and is coming off his worst statistical season since his rookie year. Graham played 55% of the snaps, handled a 12% target share and posted a 38-447-3 receiving line despite appearing in all 16 of Green Bay''s regular-season games. Graham finished eighth at tight end in pass routes, but 21st in fantasy points. Graham figures to contribute as a seam-stretcher in Chicago, but he''ll be a part-time player in an offense with a shaky quarterback situation. Consider him a back-end TE2.');

Sternberger didn''t make his NFL debut until Week 9 due to injury and was limited to 60 regular-season snaps, but he went on to play a larger role during a pair of playoff games. Aaron Rodgers has rarely relied much on his tight end, but the athletic 6-foot-4, 251-pound Sternberger should land in TE2 territory if he earns a starting gig. That''s enough to put him on the late-round radar.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('25','Ian Thomas','Panthers','TE','44.0','425.0','2.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','Thomas heads into his third NFL season atop the Panthers'' depth chart following the offseason departure of Greg Olsen. Thomas'' usage has thus far been all over the map, as he''s played at least 36 snaps in 14 games but no more than 13 in the other 18. He flashed in an expanded role during the final five weeks of 2018 (25-246-2), but wasn''t nearly as productive in the same situation last season (15-132-1). Thomas finished dead last among qualified tight ends in catch rate (53%), YPT (4.5) and drop rate (10.0%), though a position-high 27% of balls thrown his way were off-target. The 24-year-old is a candidate for a third-year leap, but he may be as low as fifth in line for targets in Matt Rhule''s offense. Consider him a fringe TE2.');
INSERT INTO tight_ends VALUES('26','Dawson Knox','Bills','TE','37.0','443.0','3.0','0.0','0.0','0.0','The Bills selected Knox in the third round of the 2019 draft and the Ole Miss product quickly earned his way to a significant offensive role. Knox played 64% of the offensive snaps and produced a 28-388-2 receiving line on 50 targets prior to resting in Week 17. The combination of plenty of downfield routes (his 9.2 aDOT ranked sixth) and Josh Allen''s inaccuracy (20% off-target rate ranked ninth) led to an ugly 56% catch rate (second-worst), but Knox still managed a respectable 7.8 YPT (14th-best). The 23-year-old is an obvious candidate for a step forward in his second season, but with Stefon Diggs added to Buffalo''s run-heavy offense, Knox is a borderline TE2 at best.');

The 2013 first-round pick held up for 16 games last season for the first time in his career, but a situational role limited him to 44% of the snaps and 4.0 targets per game. Eifert finished TE19 in fantasy, which marked his first top-20 campaign since 2015. New Jaguars OC Jay Gruden makes heavy use of his tight ends (career 23% target share), which benefits Eifert and second-year TE Josh Oliver. Of course, we still need to be wary of Eifert''s durability after he missed 52 of 80 possible games during the 2014-18 seasons. Eifert is a fringe TE2 at best.');

Despite missing two more games, Olsen finished sixth at the position in routes and 11th in targets, receptions, yardage and OTD. He was TE13 in fantasy, though it could''ve been better if not for bad touchdown luck (2 TD, 4.7 OTD). Olsen is now 35 and, while his move to Seattle could allow early-season fantasy relevance, it is expected that Will Dissly will return to the lineup at some point this calendar year.

That usage allowed him a TE18 fantasy campaign in 2018, though with Tyler Eifert back last season, Uzomah was limited to a 40th-place finish. Eifert is now with the Jaguars, which solidifies Uzomah and second-year blocking TE Drew Sample atop the depth chart.

Seattle signed Greg Olsen during the offseason, so Dissly may struggle for consistent fantasy production at least until late in the 2020 season. He should not be drafted unless cleared earlier than expected.');

He appears to be on track after posting a 56-639-4 receiving line (TE9 in fantasy) in 2018, but injuries and a demotion courtesy of Freddie Kitchens led to a grand total of 10 targets in four games last season. It''s possible tight end-friendly new head coach Kevin Stefanski can get Njoku''s career back on track, but Cleveland''s heavy investment in Austin Hooper is crushing for Njoku''s fantasy upside. The 24-year-old is a long shot for anything more than a situational role and not worth drafting in most formats.');

The 2013 second-round pick has yet to manage a full 16-game season, but he was busy last season, playing 77% of the Steelers'' snaps in 14 games. McDonald wasn''t a fantasy factor as a short-range target, having posted a 4.3 aDOT (second-lowest) and 7.2 YPR (lowest). McDonald is not much of a threat to score (he''s never cleared four TDs in a season) and is a strong bet for a reduction in snaps with Eric Ebron on board.

He has drawn Austin Hooper and Tyler Higbee comparisons as a player who figures to develop into a pass-catching in-line tight end.

Other than Javon Hargrave, the entire 2019 defensive core is set to return for 2020. The likes of T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward and Minkah Fitzpatrick provide this unit with plenty of star power, and youngsters Devin Bush and Terrell Edmunds could add to it this season. The Steelers'' D/ST should be one of the first off the board during your draft.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('2','Bills D/ST','41','13','11','3','Yet another strong performance from Sean McDermott''s defense helped the Bills'' D/ST to a second-consecutive top-seven fantasy season in 2019. Buffalo ranked no worse than eighth in interceptions, forced fumbles and points allowed, and was top-three in yardage allowed for the second consecutive season. While Lorenzo Alexander (retirement) will be missed, the Buffalo defense is arguably better after adding Quinton Jefferson, Mario Addison and Josh Norman. Led by the likes of Tre''Davious White, Jordan Poyer, Micah Hyde, Jerry Hughes and emerging youngsters Ed Oliver and Tremaine Edmunds, the Bills'' D/ST is arguably your best option in fantasy.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('3','49ers D/ST','44','13','13','3','After four consecutive seasons finishing 29th or worse, the 49ers'' D/ST climbed all the way up to third during a breakout 2019. San Francisco ranked no lower than fifth in forced fumbles, sacks, yardage allowed, points allowed and D/ST touchdowns. Trading away arguably their best player in DeForest Buckner is a big loss for the 49ers, but the good news is that the rest of the team''s 2019 core remains in place. Nick Bosa, Arik Armstead, Richard Sherman and Jimmie Ward provide the star power, with Kwon Alexander and Dee Ford likely to bring more to the table at full health this season. The 49ers'' D/ST remains a top fantasy option.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('4','Colts D/ST','42','11','10','3','The Colts'' D/ST has finished 13th in fantasy points each of the past two seasons, but the unit is trending up following the offseason acquisition of star DT DeForest Buckner. The former 49ers standout should help generate pressure for a unit that has finished top 10 in interceptions each of the past two seasons, but 15th or worse in sacks each of the past five seasons. The Indianapolis defense otherwise saw only minor offseason turnover and returns a unit led by Buckner, Justin Houston, Darius Leonard, Kenny Moore and Malik Hooker. As an added bonus, Nyheim Hines was responsible for two of the league''s seven punt return touchdowns last season. Consider the Colts'' D/ST a midrange starting unit.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('5','Patriots D/ST','41','14','8','2','The Patriots were the top-scoring fantasy D/ST by a massive 34 points last season. No D/ST has finished No. 1 in the category in back-to-back seasons over the past decade, but New England has been very reliable under Bill Belichick, ranking in the top 10 seven of the past eight seasons. Last season''s unit was incredible, ranking first or second in INTs, yardage allowed, points allowed, D/ST touchdowns and forced turnovers. Though we should expect another solid campaign, keep in mind that the Patriots already regressed from their early 2019 dominance, ranking as the No. 12 D/ST from Week 9 on. The unit also had a rough offseason, losing and not completely replacing key performers Kyle Van Noy, Jamie Collins, Duron Harmon and Danny Shelton. A stacked secondary led by Stephon Gilmore and Devin McCourty remains in place, but we should expect a return to midrange starter production from this unit in 2020.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('6','Ravens D/ST','42','14','10','2','The Ravens lost a ton of top-end talent during the 2019 free-agency period and it showed early, but quality coaching and a few in-season transactions turned things around and allowed their D/ST a third consecutive top-four fantasy season. Baltimore ranked fourth in yardage allowed, third in points allowed and second in D/ST touchdowns, with six. The 2020 offseason brought another exodus of key defenders, including Brandon Carr, Michael Pierce and Patrick Onwuasor, but the additions of Calais Campbell, Derek Wolfe and first-round pick Patrick Queen, as well as the return of Tavon Young to a loaded secondary, sets this unit up for another strong campaign. Consider the Ravens'' D/ST a solid starting option.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('7','Broncos D/ST','39','13','8','2','The Broncos'' D/ST has finished in the upper half of the league in fantasy points eight of the past nine seasons and, though 2019 was the exception, there is reason for optimism that Vic Fangio''s unit will make a leap in 2020. Denver struggled with big plays last season (27th in forced turnovers and one touchdown), but ranked 12th or better in both yardage and points allowed. The offseason additions of Jurrell Casey and A.J. Bouye, as well as a return to health for Bradley Chubb and Bryce Callahan, more than offset the losses of Chris Harris and Derek Wolfe. Add that to a core that includes Von Miller, Justin Simmons, Kareem Jackson and unheralded AJ Johnson, and the Denver D/ST has the look of a fantasy starter in 2020.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('8','Saints D/ST','42','13','10','3','The Saints'' D/ST finished eighth in fantasy points last season and has now produced a pair of top-10 campaigns over the past three seasons. New Orleans has finished top five in sacks each of the past two seasons and came in average or better in interceptions, forced turnovers, yardage allowed and points allowed during both campaigns. The team''s offseason departures (Vonn Bell, Eli Apple and A.J. Klein) all have replacements (Malcolm Jenkins, Janoris Jenkins and Alex Anzalone, respectively), and literally every other defender who played at least 32 snaps last season remains on the roster. With Cameron Jordan, Demario Davis, Marshon Lattimore, Marcus Williams and Sheldon Rankins also in the fold, the Saints'' D/ST is a starting-caliber unit with big upside.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('9','Bears D/ST','39','11','11','3','One season after dominating the NFL with 55 more fantasy points than any other D/ST, Chicago plummeted to 15th in 2019. The Bears fell from a league-high 11 top-10 fantasy weeks in 2018 to three (24th) in 2019. Chicago was still solid in terms of yardage (eighth) and points (fifth) allowed, but plummeted from first to 22nd in forced turnovers and third to 24th in sacks. On the plus side, impact KR Cordarrelle Patterson scored his fifth return touchdown in as many seasons. The Bears lost three of their top six and seven of their top 12 defenders in terms of snaps during the offseason, including Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Leonard Floyd and Prince Amukamara. The addition of Robert Quinn and return of Akiem Hicks will help, but, even with the likes of Khalil Mack, Eddie Jackson, Danny Trevathan and Kyle Fuller, this unit isn''t nearly as intimidating as it was in 2018. Consider it a back-end starting option.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('10','Vikings D/ST','39','13','11','3','The Minnesota D/ST posted its second consecutive fifth-place fantasy campaign last season and has now finished no lower than 11th over the past five seasons. Minnesota has finished top seven in points allowed each of the past five seasons, top five in sacks each of the past two seasons and was top five in both interceptions and forced fumbles in 2019. Despite the success, it''s fair to expect a step back in 2020 following the departures of Everson Griffen, Linval Joseph and literally all three of the team''s top three corners from 2019. The addition of Michael Pierce helps, and star power remains in the form of Danielle Hunter, Eric Kendricks, Harrison Smith and Anthony Harris, but unproven cornerbacks and overall depth are major red flags. Consider the Minnesota D/ST a borderline fantasy starter.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('11','Buccaneers D/ST','40','13','12','2','All eyes are on Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay offense this offseason, but don''t overlook a defense that is trending in the right direction. The upward trajectory began last season, with Tampa Bay scoring 15 more fantasy points than the next-closest D/ST from Week 12 on. In total, the Buccaneers ended up third in forced fumbles, seventh in sacks, first in passes defensed and second in D/ST touchdowns. Tampa Bay re-signed Ndamukong Suh, Shaquil Barrett and Jason Pierre-Paul during the offseason, which means 11 of team''s top 12 snap-getters on defense are on the 2020 roster. The defense is also loaded with recent early-round picks who could make a leap, including Antoine Winfield Jr., Devin White, Vita Vea, Carlton Davis, Sean Murphy-Bunting, Jamel Dean and Mike Edwards. Add in standout LB Lavonte David and Justin Evans'' return from a foot injury and you have the look of a D/ST that could take a big leap in 2020.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('12','Jets D/ST','37','13','9','2','The Jets'' D/ST hasn''t been a dominant fantasy force since the Rex Ryan era, but the unit took a step forward with a seventh-place finish in 2019. New York allowed the seventh-fewest yards, paced the league with 117 tackles for loss and scored six D/ST touchdowns. Holes remain at cornerback and edge rusher, but there''s something to be said for continuity as 15 of the team''s top 16 defenders in snaps played last season remain on the roster. Jamal Adams, second-year Quinnen Williams and now-healthy C.J. Mosley set this unit up with plenty of potential star power. Consider the Jets'' D/ST a back-end starting option.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('13','Chargers D/ST','36','11','7','3','The Chargers fell well short of lofty expectations in 2019, and that also applies to the team''s D/ST. The unit fell to 21st in fantasy points following three consecutive top-12 campaigns. Los Angeles still showed well in terms of yards (sixth) and points (12th) allowed, but forced a league-low 14 turnovers and managed only 30 sacks (28th). Thomas Davis and Adrian Phillips were the team''s only significant offseason losses, with the overall defense upgraded following the addition of Linval Joseph, Chris Harris Jr. and first-round-pick Kenneth Murray to a group that also includes Joey Bosa, Melvin Ingram, Derwin James, Casey Hayward and Desmond King (who has returned one punt for a touchdown each of the past two seasons). This is a fringe starting D/ST.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('14','Cowboys D/ST','41','13','9','3','The Dallas D/ST has been a mid-pack fantasy unit each of the past five seasons, but some savvy offseason moves have the Cowboys pointed in the right direction for 2020. Byron Jones, Robert Quinn, Maliek Collins and Jeff Heath are out, but Gerald McCoy, Dontari Poe, Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and perhaps Randy Gregory and Aldon Smith are in, not to mention a return to full health for Tyrone Crawford and Leighton Vander Esch. Dallas has finished no worse than 11th in points or yardage allowed each of the past three seasons, but hasn''t finished better than 24th in sacks since 2014. This is a solid unit and borderline top-10 fantasy D/ST.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('15','Bengals D/ST','38','12','9','3','It''s not uncommon for a D/ST to jump from the basement of the league to fantasy relevance in one season, and the Bengals are a strong candidate to do exactly that in 2020. A bottom-four D/ST each of the past two seasons, Cincinnati overhauled its defense with D.J. Reader, Trae Waynes, Mackensie Alexander, Von Bell and Josh Bynes during free agency. They join a solid core led by Geno Atkins, Carlos Dunlap and William Jackson. The improvements were a must for a defense that hasn''t ranked in the upper half of the league in forced turnovers, forced fumbles or yardage allowed since 2015. Consider drafting the Bengals'' D/ST late in deeper leagues.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('16','Lions D/ST','39','12','10','3','No outlook available.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('17','Browns D/ST','40','13','9','2','The Cleveland defense appeared ready for a big step forward in 2019, but underwhelming production in most categories instead left its D/ST without a top-20 fantasy performance for the fifth consecutive season. Cleveland finished 2019 among the top eight teams in interceptions for the second straight season, but came in 20th or worse in sacks for the sixth year in a row. The Browns'' defense is in decent shape for 2020, with Myles Garrett, Sheldon Richardson, Olivier Vernon and Denzel Ward offering star power and additions Andrew Billings, Adrian Clayborn, Karl Joseph and Grant Delpit helping to offset a few losses. The Browns'' D/ST is a midrange fantasy option.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('18','Chiefs D/ST','42','12','9','3','The Kansas City defense took a big leap forward under Steve Spagnuolo last season and it resulted in an 11th-place fantasy finish for the team''s D/ST. The Chiefs haven''t finished worse than ninth in interceptions since 2014 or worse than 10th in D/ST touchdowns since 2012. They haven''t finished in the upper half of the league in yardage allowed since 2015, but did jump to eighth in points allowed in 2019. Kansas City''s defense definitely doesn''t pop on paper, but a solid 2019 unit will return its top 11 snap-getters this season. That group includes one of the league''s elite players in Chris Jones, as well as stars Tyrann Mathieu and Frank Clark. Led by Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman, the Chiefs have at least one kick or punt return touchdown each of the past four seasons. This is a fringe starting-caliber D/ST option.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('19','Rams D/ST','40','13','9','3','The Rams'' D/ST finished as fantasy''s No. 9 scoring unit last season, which marks its third consecutive top 10 and seventh finish of 12th or better over the past eight seasons. The Rams finished eighth or better in forced turnovers and D/ST touchdowns for the third straight season. Los Angeles'' 11 top-10 fantasy weeks last season led the league. Seven of those came in 10 games after Jalen Ramsey joined the team. Despite the strong finish, there''s reason for some concern here. Ramsey is back (as are Aaron Donald and John Johnson), but three of the defense''s top four snap-getters from 2019 (Cory Littleton, Dante Fowler and Eric Weddle) are among the departed, leaving the team with shaky situations at edge rusher, linebacker and corner. The Rams'' D/ST is best left on waivers in most formats.');
INSERT INTO defense VALUES('20','Titans D/ST','37','13','6','2','The Titans'' D/ST finished a respectable 12th in fantasy points last season and has now produced back-to-back top-12 campaigns. The Titans jumped to eighth in interceptions and scored four touchdowns, while ranking in the upper half of the league in sacks for the sixth consecutive season. On the other hand, they fell to 21st in yardage allowed and 13th in point allowed. Jurrell Casey and Logan Ryan were huge offseason losses, but a strong core led by Adoree'' Jackson, Kevin Byard, Jayon Brown and Harold Landry remains in place. The Titans'' D/ST is best-valued as a middle-of-the-pack option.');

INSERT INTO defense VALUES('23','Seahawks D/ST','39','13','8','3','The Seahawks'' D/ST has been trending down in recent seasons, and the unit''s 17th-place 2019 campaign marked its worst finish since 2010. Seattle ranked third in the league with 32 forced turnovers last season, but allowed the seventh-most yards, 19th-most points and finished 29th in sacks. Jadeveon Clowney, Quinton Jefferson and Mychal Kendricks lead the team''s list of key offseason losses, though the additions of first-round-pick Jordyn Brooks, Quinton Dunbar and Bruce Irvin to a core that includes Bobby Wagner, K.J. Wright, Shaquill Griffin and Jarran Reed removes some of the sting. This has the look of a midrange fantasy D/ST.');
