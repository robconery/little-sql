1,Lamar Jackson,Ravens,QB,296.0,465.0,3425.0,25.0,10.0,156.0,902.0,6.0,"The 2019 NFL MVP is fresh off a breakout season in which he outscored the next-closest quarterback by 78 fantasy points despite resting in Week 17. The dual-threat weapon threw 36 touchdowns to only six interceptions while adding a record-setting 176-1,206-7 rushing line -- that rushing production alone would've ranked 28th among running backs. The question is: Can he do it again? History says no, as his 9.0% TD rate (highest the NFL has seen over the past decade) is unsustainable, and the last quarterback to repeat as the top-scoring fantasy QB was Daunte Culpepper in 2004. On the other hand, Jackson's rushing volume and prowess give him an extremely high floor, as shown by his 11 top-six fantasy weeks in 15 outings last season. Jackson's unique style makes him an elite fantasy weapon and worth a look early in Round 3."
2,Patrick Mahomes,Chiefs,QB,364.0,557.0,4465.0,32.0,10.0,61.0,280.0,3.0,"Patrick Mahomes is 24 years old and has 36 NFL starts under his belt yet has already been named both league and Super Bowl MVP. So where does he go from here? Well, considering he still has Andy Reid's pass-heavy scheme, a strong offensive line and a terrific group of targets led by Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce at his disposal, we should probably expect more of the same. Granted, Mahomes returned to earth a bit last season (4,031 passing yards, 28 total TDs) after his breakout 2018 campaign (5,097 yards, 52 TDs), but he was still unquestionably one of the best players in the league. Mahomes was fantasy's No. 3 scoring QB during the 13 weeks he played in full, and that doesn't even count his 12 touchdowns in three playoff games. Mahomes remains an elite fantasy option."
3,Deshaun Watson,Texans,QB,337.0,517.0,4018.0,27.0,12.0,87.0,519.0,4.0,"Watson enters his fourth NFL season fresh off back-to-back fourth-place finishes in fantasy. The 24-year-old has emerged as one of the game's best players, ranking no lower than eighth in completion percentage and 13th in yards per attempt in each of the past two seasons. Watson has yet to clear 26 passing touchdowns in a season, but he makes up a ton of ground with his legs, ranking top-four in rushing attempts, yards and touchdowns in each of the past two seasons. The elephant in the room is the loss of top weapon DeAndre Hopkins, though it's worth noting that Watson has averaged a strong 9.2 YPA to wide receivers other than Hopkins in his career. Watson remains a solid fantasy starter."
4,Dak Prescott,Cowboys,QB,350.0,543.0,4280.0,27.0,11.0,49.0,248.0,4.0,"Prescott will be back under center for Dallas following his best professional season in 2019. Prescott ranked no lower than sixth among quarterbacks in pass attempts (596), completions (388), passing yardage (4,902), passing touchdowns (30), yards per pass attempt (8.2) and average depth of throw (9.4) -- all while dealing with a league-high 30 drops. Also a factor as a rusher (52-277-3), Prescott finished a career-best second at the position in fantasy points. Armed with a terrific line, as well as WRs Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup and CeeDee Lamb, Prescott should be considered a solid QB1 option."
5,Russell Wilson,Seahawks,QB,300.0,473.0,3692.0,29.0,9.0,73.0,397.0,2.0,"The 2019 season was a tale of two halves for Wilson. He was the top-scoring fantasy QB through Week 6 but was held to three top-12 weeks and the 11th-most points the rest of the season. At the end of the day, he had his eighth top-11 fantasy campaign in as many tries, which includes four top-three seasons since 2014. Wilson remains a force with his legs (he's ranked no lower than ninth among QBs in rushing yards in his career), but he's also ranked top-three in passing touchdowns (33.3 per season) in each of the past three seasons. With Tyler Lockett, second-year receiver DK Metcalf and newcomer Greg Olsen at his disposal, the 31-year-old Wilson remains a solid QB1."
6,Kyler Murray,Cardinals,QB,349.0,544.0,3819.0,26.0,12.0,87.0,469.0,3.0,"Murray's rookie season had its ups and downs, which is exactly what you'd expect from a first-year starting quarterback. The 2019 first overall pick struggled to 6.9 YPA and took a league-high 48 sacks, but he also finished strong by leading the Arizona offense to three-plus touchdowns in eight of the team's final 11 games. Murray's rushing ability helped him to a 93-544-4 rushing line (top-four in all three categories) and an eighth-place finish in fantasy points. Murray was already a strong bet for a second-year leap, but the addition of DeAndre Hopkins further adds to his appeal. The hype might lead to an irresponsible ADP, but there's little doubt Murray has elite upside. He's a solid fantasy starter."
7,Tom Brady,Buccaneers,QB,361.0,575.0,4455.0,31.0,9.0,24.0,27.0,2.0,"In case you were living under a rock during the offseason, Tom Brady is now on the Buccaneers. The 43-year-old hasn't been much of a fantasy force in recent seasons, having finished 12th or worse among QBs in fantasy points in three of the past four seasons and four of the past seven. He's also coming off arguably his worst professional season (24 pass TDs, 61% completion rate, 6.6 YPA). Of course, there's plenty of reason to expect a bounce-back in Tampa, as his top targets go from Julian Edelman, James White and Mohamed Sanu to Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and old friend Rob Gronkowski. Brady adds very little with his legs but avoids turnovers and figures to push the ball downfield more in Bruce Arians' high-volume, pass-first attack. Consider the GOAT a back-end QB1."
8,Matt Ryan,Falcons,QB,390.0,600.0,4533.0,28.0,12.0,32.0,125.0,1.0,"Ryan's bizarre roller-coaster career continued in 2019, as his 11th-place fantasy campaign means he has finished outside the top 10 QBs in fantasy points during odd years and no lower than seventh in even years, going all the way back to 2012. In Ryan's defense, he missed a game (his first since 2009) and still played well, ranking top-nine in completion percentage for the eighth consecutive season. Ryan also paced all QBs in completions (408) and finished top-six in passing yards for the 10th straight season. Operating in Dirk Koetter's high-volume offense with Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, Todd Gurley and five first-round picks on the offensive line, Ryan has a high floor and is a fringe QB1."
9,Matthew Stafford,Lions,QB,344.0,539.0,4213.0,27.0,11.0,33.0,123.0,1.0,"Stafford missed half of the 2019 season due to injury, but don't let that overshadow what was otherwise a very strong campaign. The Lions' offense scored 21 touchdowns during his eight starts (2.6 per game; 1.8 per game in the other eight), and Stafford finished 62.5% (five of eight) of his starts as a top-10 fantasy QB, which was the position's fourth-best rate. Powered by a league-high 10.8 aDOT (average depth of target), Stafford's career-high 8.6 YPA was second best in the league. Prior to last season, the 32-year-old had not missed a game since 2010, and he is well-positioned behind a solid line and with Kenny Golladay, Marvin Jones Jr. and second-year TE T.J. Hockenson as his primary weapons. Consider Stafford a strong QB2."
10,Carson Wentz,Eagles,QB,337.0,527.0,3801.0,27.0,9.0,54.0,213.0,2.0,"Despite his wide receiver room being absolutely ravaged by injuries, Wentz posted his second career top-10 fantasy campaign in 2019. Volume was the primary reason, as the 27-year-old ranked first in snaps, fifth in pass attempts and seventh in carries among QBs. Wentz dealt with 24 drops (third most) and got very little after the catch for the fourth consecutive season (4.8 RAC). Perhaps most important, Wentz held up, handling 99% of the Eagles' dropbacks before a concussion suffered in the playoffs. Wentz will work behind an elite offensive line and with a solid group of weapons in 2020. He's a back-end QB1."
11,Drew Brees,Saints,QB,363.0,518.0,4011.0,30.0,9.0,20.0,11.0,1.0,"Brees missed six games due to injury last season and also ceded occasional snaps to Taysom Hill. The future Hall of Famer was still fantasy's No. 2 scoring QB during the 10 weeks he was active, producing 28 touchdowns and only three interceptions. Brees continues to win with elite efficiency, having paced the NFL in completion percentage in each of the past three seasons while ranking no lower than 10th in YPA during that span. Brees' supporting cast is arguably better this season, with Emmanuel Sanders added to a group that includes Michael Thomas, Jared Cook, Alvin Kamara and a quality line. Now 41, Brees is a back-end QB1."
12,Josh Allen,Bills,QB,291.0,483.0,3414.0,18.0,11.0,96.0,545.0,5.0,"Allen is the perfect example of why rushing is so important when it comes to QB fantasy evaluations. The 2018 first-round pick finished as fantasy's No. 6 QB last season despite ranking 23rd in passing yards, 21st with only 20 passing TDs, third worst in completion percentage (59%) and 11th worst in YPA (6.7). Of course, Allen also produced a 109-510-9 rushing line and has now paced the position in rushing TDs in each of his two NFL seasons (17 total). Allen's passing troubles remain a red flag, but the addition of Stefon Diggs should help his cause. As long as he keeps running, Allen will be a back-end QB1 option."
13,Aaron Rodgers,Packers,QB,333.0,528.0,3820.0,26.0,8.0,43.0,206.0,1.0,"Once a perennial top-two fantasy QB, Rodgers has settled in as more of a mid-to-back-end QB1 in recent seasons. That included 2019, which saw him finish ninth in fantasy points even though he appeared in all 16 games and ranked eighth in pass attempts. Rodgers' efficiency has been a culprit, as he hasn't finished better than 16th in YPA since 2014 after previously dominating the category. He also hasn't cleared 26 pass TDs in a season since 2016 and is no longer much of a factor with his legs. Rodgers has Davante Adams, Aaron Jones and a solid line at his disposal, but the 36-year-old is no longer an elite fantasy weapon."
14,Daniel Jones,Giants,QB,339.0,536.0,3718.0,25.0,13.0,52.0,267.0,2.0,"Jones was in and out of the lineup during his rookie campaign, but the 2019 sixth overall pick certainly made an impact when on the field. During 12 starts, Jones paced all rookie QBs with 24 pass TDs and was fifth in fantasy points. Jones' efficiency wasn't good (62% completion rate, 6.6 YPA), but inconsistency is common for rookie passers. Despite the Giants' top targets playing zero games together due to injury, the New York offense ranked 13th in touchdowns during Jones' rookie campaign. Jones is armed with a solid supporting cast and adds value with his legs (he ranked seventh in rushing yards as a rookie). Consider him a fringe top-12 QB and a breakout candidate."
15,Jared Goff,Rams,QB,369.0,578.0,4280.0,22.0,13.0,31.0,64.0,2.0,"The Rams' offense took a step back last season, but heavy volume allowed Goff to make occasional noise in fantasy. Goff finished top-five in pass attempts, completions and yards, which helped him to seven top-10 fantasy weeks (fifth most). The 2016 first overall pick has finished 12th, seventh and 13th in fantasy points during Sean McVay's three seasons. He adds very little with his legs (40 rushing yards last season) but still manages to hang in as a streaming option thanks to McVay. In 2020, Goff will have a strong group of targets led by Robert Woods, Tyler Higbee and Cooper Kupp, though the Rams' line remains a concern. Consider Goff a midrange QB2."
16,Ben Roethlisberger,Steelers,QB,339.0,529.0,3867.0,25.0,12.0,27.0,73.0,1.0,"Roethlisberger is back in Pittsburgh after missing all but two games due to injury last season. The last time we saw Roethlisberger for a full season, the Steelers' offense set a franchise record with 51 touchdowns in 2018. Roethlisberger paced the NFL in dropbacks (712), attempts (675) and completions (452), while finishing top-five in passing yards (5,086), passing touchdowns (34) and fantasy points (342) that season. The 38-year-old finished eighth or better in fantasy points per game in five straight seasons prior to 2019. Roethlisberger adds little with his legs, but he has a good line, an intriguing WR trio led by JuJu Smith-Schuster, and newcomer TE Eric Ebron in the fold. Consider Big Ben a top-15 option with QB1 upside."
17,Ryan Tannehill,Titans,QB,296.0,447.0,3491.0,23.0,11.0,58.0,206.0,2.0,"Tannehill signed a four-year extension with Tennessee following an impressive bounce-back 2019 campaign in which he completed 70% of his passes (third best) and posted 9.6 YPA (first). Tennessee scored three-plus touchdowns in 12 of Tannehill's 13 starts, which helped the 31-year-old to the third-most fantasy points among quarterbacks from Week 7 on. Tannehill has been around since 2012, but he has finished only one season as a top-15 fantasy QB and is a strong bet for statistical regression to the mean. With the Titans' extremely run-heavy offense also in mind, the veteran passer is best viewed as a solid QB2."
18,Baker Mayfield,Browns,QB,314.0,501.0,3656.0,25.0,15.0,33.0,130.0,2.0,"Mayfield was one of 2019's biggest busts, with preseason concerns related to interceptions, a lack of rushing production and shaky offensive tackles all proving problematic when push came to shove. The 2018 first overall pick appeared in all 16 of Cleveland's games and was 10th in pass attempts, but he managed only 25 total touchdowns to go along with 21 interceptions (second most), 40 sacks (seventh) and 141 rushing yards (20th). Mayfield was fantasy's No. 20 scoring QB and managed only two weekly finishes better than ninth. A supporting cast led by Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, Nick Chubb, Kareem Hunt and Austin Hooper is a positive, as is the arrival of new coach Kevin Stefanski. Mayfield is a fine post-hype sleeper but shouldn't be counted on as a starter just yet."
19,Jimmy Garoppolo,49ers,QB,314.0,467.0,3704.0,25.0,13.0,45.0,74.0,2.0,"The 49ers were the best team in the NFC last season, but that did not lead to much fantasy relevance for Garoppolo. Appearing in more than six games in a single season for the first time in his career, Garoppolo finished 14th in fantasy points and was held to four top-10 weeks (18 QBs had more). Garoppolo tossed 27 touchdowns (fifth most) and was efficient (69% completion rate, 8.4 YPA), but he lacked opportunity in San Francisco's run-heavy offense (he finished 19th in pass attempts) and added very little with his legs (46-62-1 rushing line). Garoppolo has a good supporting cast led by George Kittle, Deebo Samuel and a great line, but the 28-year-old figures to cap out as a QB2 in Kyle Shanahan's run-heavy scheme."
20,Joe Burrow,Bengals,QB,328.0,527.0,3687.0,20.0,13.0,54.0,258.0,2.0,"The Bengals selected Burrow with the No. 1 pick of April's draft. Burrow doesn't have the strongest arm, but he is extremely accurate and has good size (6-foot-3, 221 pounds), playmaking ability and mobility. The LSU product completed 76% of his passes, registered as off target on 7.7% of his throws and posted a 94.9 total QBR during the 2019 season, all of which were best in this year's rookie class. Burrow also adds value with his legs (368 rushing yards, 5 TDs), which only adds to his fantasy upside. Burrow will be a Week 1 starter, but as is the norm for rookie passers, he's a long shot to reach QB1 status in 2020."
21,Kirk Cousins,Vikings,QB,335.0,495.0,3739.0,21.0,9.0,33.0,93.0,2.0,"Cousins may be conservative, but there's no denying he was one of the league's most effective passers last season. The eight-year vet completed 69% of his passes (top-5 for the second consecutive season) and posted an 8.1 YPA (seventh best). Despite the efficiency, Cousins was not a good fantasy QB. Minnesota's run-heavy offense was problematic, as he posted one weekly finish better than sixth and was outside the top 20 in eight of 15 starts. Cousins hasn't used his legs as often in Minnesota as he did in Washington, which has been a factor in his 12th- and 15th-place finishes among QBs in fantasy during the past two seasons. Especially with Stefon Diggs gone, Cousins is a mid-to-back-end QB2."
22,Philip Rivers,Colts,QB,335.0,517.0,3834.0,26.0,15.0,16.0,30.0,0.0,"Rivers is now the starter in Indianapolis, following 16 seasons with the Chargers. Rivers joins the Colts following a 2019 campaign in which he did some things well (66% C%, 7.8 YPA) but struggled elsewhere (20 INTs, 48.6 QBR). Rivers hasn't finished a season better than eighth in fantasy points since 2013 and has one top-10 during the span. He offers almost zero with his legs (34 yards and zero TDs the past three seasons). Relative to last season in LA, Rivers' primary targets in Indianapolis won't be quite as good, but his offensive line will be substantially better. Though Rivers is an upgrade for the Colts, he is still unlikely to provide consistent QB1 numbers. He's worth a look only in 2QB leagues."
23,Gardner Minshew II,Jaguars,QB,321.0,510.0,3616.0,19.0,9.0,56.0,288.0,1.0,"Minshew's ascent was one of the league's best stories of 2019, as the Washington State star quickly emerged from sixth-round draft pick to the Jaguars' starting quarterback. Minshew appeared in 14 games and tossed 21 touchdowns to only six interceptions. The efficiency wasn't great (61 C%, 7.0 YPA, 19% off-target rate), but Minshew made up some ground with his legs, ranking fifth among QBs with 344 rushing yards. Following the Nick Foles trade to Chicago, Minshew is allbut locked in as the 2020 Jaguars' starter. New offensive coordinator Jay Gruden's resume, combined with Jacksonville's shaky defense, suggests Minshew will be throwing plenty. That's enough to make him a QB2 and deep sleeper."
24,Drew Lock,Broncos,QB,315.0,494.0,3534.0,21.0,11.0,51.0,221.0,1.0,"The Denver defense is in excellent shape behind defensive-minded coach Vic Fangio, so the pressure will be on the second-year Lock to get this team back to the playoffs. The 2019 second-round pick failed to make much noise in five starts as a rookie, averaging a weak 6.5 YPA and managing only one weekly fantasy finish better than 20th. Denver is expected to continue leaning on a run-first offense, though Lock's supporting cast is looking much better after the team added Melvin Gordon, Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler to a group that already included Courtland Sutton, Noah Fant and Phillip Lindsay. Not a huge factor as a rusher, Lock figures to be limited to mid-to-back-end QB2 production, though he's an obvious deep sleeper in his second season."
25,Sam Darnold,Jets,QB,321.0,522.0,3650.0,22.0,14.0,42.0,108.0,2.0,"Darnold's career is off to a slow start, with the USC product having missed three games due to injury/illness during each of his two seasons. He has a total of 39 touchdowns to go along with 28 INTs, and his 60% completion rate and 6.9 YPA are both well below average. Darnold hasn't been afraid to push the ball down the field (8.9 aDOT), but he adds little with his legs and has made little fantasy impact. The 2018 third overall pick posted four top-10 fantasy weeks but was 20th or worse in eight of his other nine outings last season. With an improved line and Chris Herndon back, Darnold's supporting cast is better in 2020, but he'll need a giant leap in order to come close to the QB1 discussion."
26,Cam Newton,Patriots,QB,266.0,428.0,2946.0,18.0,10.0,71.0,360.0,3.0,"Newton signed with the Patriots following nine seasons in Carolina. The dual-threat quarterback was playing some of the best ball of his career in 2018, but that campaign was cut short by a late-season shoulder injury and a foot injury derailed his 2019 campaign. Newton attempted only 89 passes and ran the ball five times in two games prior to being shut down for the season. Now that he's 31 years old, it's fair to wonder whether he can still be a factor with his legs and, if not, can he make up for it with his arm? Even missing two games in 2018, Newton finished top five at the position in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns for the eighth consecutive season, so it's very possible he has something left in the tank. He's worth a late-round flier, as he'll be back on the QB1 radar if he beats out Jarrett Stidham."
27,Dwayne Haskins Jr.,FA,QB,323.0,519.0,3726.0,18.0,14.0,42.0,188.0,1.0,"The 15th-overall pick of the 2019 draft, Haskins appeared in nine games as a rookie and is expected to open the 2020 season as Washington's starting QB. The word 'expected' is notable here, as his job security is tenuous after new coach Ron Rivera traded for Kyle Allen ' his 2019 starter in Carolina. Haskins will also need to up his game after ranking among the league's worst in completion percentage (59%), off-target rate (22%), and YPA (6.7) on 203 rookie-season attempts. Haskins failed to finish a week better than 10th in fantasy points, and it's hard to expect much improvement in 2020 with an unproven group of targets behind Terry McLaurin and with minimal contributions from his legs."
28,Derek Carr,Raiders,QB,305.0,457.0,3389.0,20.0,9.0,25.0,70.0,1.0,"Carr played better last season than you probably realize, but once again it didn't lead to much fantasy success. Granted, he was very conservative (6.6 aDOT), but Carr completed 70% of his passes (second highest) and posted a 7.9 YPA (ninth) all while dealing with 24 drops (third most). That efficiency helped him to only one top-10 fantasy week prior to a pair of eighth-place showings when it mattered the least during Weeks 16-17. Carr has never posted a top-10 fantasy campaign in six NFL seasons and has finished 16th or worse each of the past three seasons. The Raiders' offense simply hasn't scored enough to overcome Carr's conservatism and low-end rushing production. Rookie additions Henry Ruggs III, Lynn Bowden and Bryan Edwards will help, but Carr remains a fringe QB2."
29,Teddy Bridgewater,Panthers,QB,323.0,503.0,3610.0,17.0,10.0,44.0,75.0,1.0,"Bridgewater will replace Cam Newton as Carolina's starter following a pair of seasons as Drew Brees' backup. Bridgewater has barely seen the field since 2015 but was forced into extended action in six games last season. He showed fairly well, tossing nine TDs to two INTs while completing 68% of his passes (sixth best). Bridgewater was very conservative ' his 6.1 aDOT was easily lowest in the league, but he still managed the 11th-most fantasy points during that span. Bridgewater will work with innovative rookie head coach Matt Rhule and has a decent group of weapons led by DJ Moore, Curtis Samuel, Robby Anderson and Christian McCaffrey. Bridgewater's conservative game and minimal rushing contributions (31 rushing yards last season) limit him to fringe QB2 territory."
30,Tua Tagovailoa,Dolphins,QB,288.0,467.0,3263.0,17.0,12.0,35.0,139.0,1.0,"Miami selected Tagovailoa with the fifth pick of April's draft. A dominant player during his time at Alabama, Tagovailoa very well could've been selected first overall if not for durability concerns, especially after last season's serious hip injury. Tagovailoa is on the small side (6-foot, 217 pounds) but is a terrific decision-maker with excellent pocket presence and accuracy. His 2019 numbers were outstanding, with his 206.9 QB rating best in class and his 94.8 total QBR just behind Burrow's. Tagovailoa has QB1 upside down the road, but he might open his career behind Ryan Fitzpatrick and is unlikely to land on the fantasy radar in a rebuilding Miami offense."
31,Justin Herbert,Chargers,QB,265.0,421.0,3069.0,16.0,11.0,40.0,157.0,1.0,"The Chargers found their heir to Philip Rivers when they selected Herbert with the sixth pick of April's draft. Herbert is one of the biggest quarterbacks in this year's rookie class, at 6-foot-6, 236 pounds. Herbert, who has drawn comparisons to Ryan Tannehill and Carson Wentz, figures to add some slight value with his legs. He'll enter his first training camp behind veteran Tyrod Taylor, but it will be a surprise if he's not under center before midseason. Herbert will enjoy a decent supporting cast (Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, Hunter Henry, Austin Ekeler), but he is a long shot for rookie-season fantasy value and doesn't need to be drafted in most formats."
32,Nick Foles,Bears,QB,240.0,371.0,2626.0,13.0,8.0,17.0,18.0,1.0,"Foles' roller-coaster career continues as the 31-year-old was traded to Chicago as competition for Mitchell Trubisky. Though Foles has flashed at times, he's never played more than 13 games in a single regular season and has finished only one season better than 29th in fantasy points. Incredibly, Foles has registered exactly two weekly fantasy finishes better than 12th over the past four seasons. That includes a 2019 season in which he had only 117 attempts in Jacksonville due to injury and a later benching. Foles is a non-factor with his legs and may not even open the season as the starter. He's well off the fantasy radar."
33,Mitchell Trubisky,Bears,QB,140.0,221.0,1542.0,8.0,5.0,20.0,110.0,1.0,"Trubisky is technically atop the Bears' depth chart, but he is no longer assured of Week 1 starting duties following the team's acquisition of Nick Foles. The second overall pick in 2017, Trubisky took a step forward in his second pro season back in 2018 but regressed in nearly every category last season. Despite appearing in 15 games, Trubisky was limited to only three top-10 fantasy weeks and finished 26th in points by season's end. The 25-year-old is barely worth QB2 consideration as a starter, so with Foles lingering, he's obviously well off the fantasy radar."
34,Tyrod Taylor,Chargers,QB,69.0,110.0,814.0,5.0,2.0,16.0,84.0,1.0,"Taylor is expected to get first crack at replacing Philip Rivers in Los Angeles. The 30-year-old dual-threat quarterback has attempted only 91 passes over the past two seasons after losing starting gigs in both Buffalo and Cleveland. Taylor has never appeared in a full 16-game regular season, and his best fantasy finish was a ninth in 2016. His game is built on minimizing turnovers (18 INTs on 1,327 attempts since 2015) and rushing (top-3 at QB in rushing yards each season from 2015 to '17), though it doesn't lead to much passing production (he's never cleared 3,035 yards or 20 TDs through the air). Taylor has a decent group of targets in LA, but he will deal with a shaky line and it won't be long before sixth-overall pick Justin Herbert takes over. Only consider Taylor in two-QB leagues."
35,Ryan Fitzpatrick,Dolphins,QB,79.0,127.0,917.0,5.0,4.0,13.0,61.0,1.0,"The Dolphins' 2019 season was about as rough as expected, but the performance improved as the season progressed. That certainly applied to Fitzpatrick, who finished strongly with the third-most fantasy points among QBs during Weeks 12-17. In fact, the combination of Miami's pass-first scheme and Fitzpatrick's rushing production (54-243-4) allowed him the fourth-most fantasy points during the 13 weeks he played a bulk of the snaps. That all being said, Fitzpatrick is 37 years old, will still need to deal with a shaky offensive line and has appeared in 16 games once over the past seven seasons. Fitzpatrick may open the season as Miami's starter, but it won't be long before fifth-overall pick Tua Tagovailoa takes over. Fitzgerald doesn't need to be drafted."
36,Jarrett Stidham,Patriots,QB,75.0,116.0,787.0,5.0,3.0,10.0,43.0,0.0,"Tom Brady is out and Stidham and/or Cam Newton are in as the Patriots' quarterback. The 2019 fourth-round pick attempted only four passes during his rookie season, though he did impress during the preseason by completing 61 of 91 attempts (67%) for 731 yards (8.0 YPA), four TDs and one INT, as well as 88 rushing yards. The 23-year-old was very conservative (7.7 aDOT) and protected the ball well (36 TD, 11 INT) during 27 starts at Auburn, which fits the mold of what Brady brought to the table in 2019. Stidham is obviously a huge unknown, and his supporting cast is average at best, so he's best viewed as a dynasty hold and lottery-ticket flier in 2QB season-long leagues."
37,Marcus Mariota,Raiders,QB,51.0,81.0,597.0,4.0,2.0,10.0,52.0,0.0,"Mariota signed with the Raiders during the offseason and will back up Derek Carr. Mariota simply did not live up to the lofty expectations in Tennessee after being selected second overall in the 2015 draft. The Oregon product has been effective with his legs throughout his career (242-1,399-11 rushing line), but he takes a ton of sacks and has become a more conservative passer in recent seasons. Perhaps Mariota can overtake Carr and rejuvenate his career in a new city, but that's unlikely to happen, which obviously pushes the 26-year-old well off the fantasy radar."

41,Jalen Hurts,Eagles,QB,26.0,43.0,301.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,68.0,1.0,"The Eagles found their new backup quarterback when they selected Hurts with the 53rd pick of April's draft. Hurts is a very good athlete with 4.59 40-yard wheels and will be a playmaker as a ball carrier in the pros. The Oklahoma product ran for 1,298 yards and 20 touchdowns on 233 carries last season. Hurts is also fresh off an outstanding 2019 season as a passer, when he was off target on only 8.3% of his throws (second-best in this class) and averaged 11.3 YPA (best) despite a 10.2 aDOT (second-highest). Hurts' accuracy needs work, but he's tough and avoids turnovers. Similar in style to Tyrod Taylor, Hurts has a shot to flirt with QB1 numbers once called upon to start. That won't be anytime soon, barring an injury to Carson Wentz."

The 2015 first overall pick's 2019 season was the definition of 'YOLO,' as he led the NFL in passing yards (5,109), was second in passing touchdowns (33) and finished sixth in YPA (8.2) -- but he also completed an ugly 60.7% of his passes and threw an astounding 30 interceptions (the most the league has seen in a single season since 1988). At best, Winston will be the No. 2 QB behind Drew Brees this season, though he's not even assured starting duties in the event of a Brees injury with Taysom Hill also in the fold. Do not draft Winston."

Last season, Dalton appeared in 13 games and racked up 20 total touchdowns to go along with 14 interceptions. He posted his worst YPA (6.6) and completion rate (59%) since his rookie season in 2011. He managed one weekly fantasy finish better than 10th and hasn't finished a season better than 12th in fantasy points since 2013.

Love was very impressive at Utah State back in 2018 but struggled a bit last season. Love tossed 20 touchdowns and 17 interceptions, was off target on a class-high 15.5% of his throws, and his 51.7 total QBR was worst in the class. Love has a good arm, which shows up in his big plays, but his struggles with accuracy, turnovers and decision-making and against pressure stick out as red flags. There's obvious upside here, but Love is one of the league's youngest quarterbacks and will require some polish. He'll have time to work at it with Rodgers positioned as Green Bay's starter for the next season or three. Love obviously does not need to be drafted in 2020 leagues."

Eason has drawn comparisons to Carson Palmer and Brock Osweiler due to his huge frame (6-foot-6, 231 pounds) and very strong arm. That's enough to make Eason an attractive developmental prospect, but the former Huskie lacks mobility and will need to overcome major struggles while dealing with pressure. Eason was dramatically better at Washington last season than he was at Georgia in 2016, which adds optimism to his trajectory. He'll have plenty of time to learn behind Philip Rivers and Jacoby Brissett."

He's also on the small side (6-foot-2, 219 pounds), with shaky accuracy and an underwhelming arm. Fromm will spend his first few NFL seasons learning the ropes behind Josh Allen."
