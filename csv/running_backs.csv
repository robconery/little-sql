1,Christian McCaffrey,Panthers,RB,233.0,1048.0,9.0,90.0,736.0,3.0,"McCaffrey returns as the feature back in Carolina after a dominant 2019 campaign, when he outscored the next-closest RB by 156 fantasy points. Seriously. McCaffrey was on the field for an astronomical 93% of the offensive snaps, which was just above his 92% mark in 2018. He set a career high with an 80% carry share (17.9 per game) and has now handled 23% of the targets (8.8/G) in three consecutive seasons. McCaffrey paced the position in snaps, touches, yards, touchdowns, OTD, targets, receptions and carries inside the 5. It's possible McCaffrey will play a bit less in new coach Matt Rhule's offense, but the 24-year-old can afford a reduced role and still dominate the position in fantasy. He should be the first player off the board in your draft."
2,Ezekiel Elliott,Cowboys,RB,282.0,1244.0,10.0,57.0,455.0,2.0,"Elliott returns as the clear feature back in Dallas. Since entering the league in 2016, the Ohio State product leads the NFL in carries (1,169) and rushing yards (5,405), and sits second in rushing touchdowns (40). Elliott obviously plays a substantial role as a ball carrier -- and his goal-line work increased last season -- but it was a bit surprising to see his targets fall from 6.3 to 4.4 per game last season. Of course, Elliott's role still allowed him a top-3 finish in touches, yards and fantasy points. The 25-year-old is positioned for a similar role in 2020 behind a strong offensive line and should be off the board in the middle of the first round of drafts."
3,Saquon Barkley,Giants,RB,261.0,1176.0,10.0,57.0,458.0,3.0,"Barkley's 2019 season fell short of lofty expectations, but the 2018 second-overall pick finished strongly and remains an elite fantasy asset. Barkley, who missed three games because of injury, was on the field for 84% of New York's snaps -- about the same as his rookie season (83%) -- when active. His 16.7 carries per game were up slightly from 2018 (16.3), though his targets inexplicably fell from 7.4 to 5.5 per game. Barkley still managed the third-most fantasy points among RBs during his 12 full weeks. We shouldn't count on a big rebound in targets with Jason Garrett running the offense, but Barkley does figure to see more run at the goal line (only seven carries inside the 5 last season). Only Christian McCaffrey is a clear superior fantasy asset to 23-year-old Barkley."
4,Dalvin Cook,Vikings,RB,245.0,1051.0,10.0,64.0,536.0,1.0,"Cook's career has thus far been marred by injuries, but we saw a glimpse of his ceiling during a breakout 2019 campaign. Through Week 14, Cook led the league in rushing touchdowns and trailed only Christian McCaffrey in fantasy points. Cook missed two games and chunks of others but still finished no lower than ninth among backs in carries, receptions, touches, scrimmage yards and touchdowns. Cook's 15 carries inside the 5 were third most in the league, and he scored at least one touchdown in 11 of 14 games. Cook has now missed 19 games because of injury in three seasons, but there's no doubt the 24-year-old is positioned well as run-heavy Minnesota's primary back. He's a strong RB1 despite the durability concerns."
5,Alvin Kamara,Saints,RB,194.0,876.0,8.0,78.0,600.0,3.0,"Kamara is coming off an up-and-down 2019 campaign, but the 24-year-old remains the main man in the New Orleans' backfield. Kamara missed a pair of games but otherwise played a similar role to 2018, handling 12.2 carries and 7.0 targets per game. Kamara ended the season with a YPC above 4.5 and exactly 81 catches for the third consecutive season. A lack of usage near the goal line (7.1 OTD, 6 TDs) limited his fantasy production, though he did finish strongly with four of those scores coming during Weeks 16-17. Kamara should have little trouble pushing for 20 touches per game in the Saints' Drew Brees-led, high-scoring offense. He remains a solid RB1."
6,Kenyan Drake,Cardinals,RB,210.0,979.0,9.0,53.0,399.0,2.0,"Drake received the transition tag from the Cardinals during the offseason and will return as the team's clear feature back. Traded from Miami to Arizona at the 2019 trade deadline, Drake went on to play 381 (79%) of 483 possible snaps during his eight games with the team. He handled 66% of the team's carries (15.4 per game) and 14% of the targets (4.4) during that span. That heavy usage allowed him the fourth-most fantasy points among RBs during that span. Arizona's offense should only improve in Kliff Kingsbury and Kyler Murray's second season, so Drake, who sports an impressive 4.8 career YPC, is very much in the RB1 discussion."
7,Derrick Henry,Titans,RB,288.0,1308.0,12.0,26.0,212.0,1.0,"Henry returns as the feature back in Tennessee after pacing the NFL in carries (303), rushing yards (1,540) and rushing touchdowns (16) in 2019. Henry has been an absolute force as a rusher, ranking no lower than third in YAC each of the past three seasons. His heavy recent workload is a concern, but the good news is that he's 25 years old and had not cleared 215 carries in a season prior to 2019. Henry's minimal workload as a receiver (career-high 18 receptions last season) will continue to limit his fantasy output, so coupled with a probable dip in rushing production, he should be valued as a back-end RB1."
8,Aaron Jones,Packers,RB,206.0,914.0,11.0,44.0,366.0,2.0,"It's fair to say Jones was finally 'freed' in 2019. Green Bay's lead back set career-high marks in nearly every category, exploding for 1,558 yards (seventh most among RBs) and a league-high 19 touchdowns from scrimmage. Jones posted more duds than you'd expect from a top fantasy back (five weekly finishes outside the top 30), but still managed the second-most points at the position. Jones is a near lock for major touchdown regression this season, as his 19 TDs were nearly double his 10.8 OTD. Still, his strong efficiency and role as lead back in the Packers' offense is enough to allow the 25-year-old Jones solid RB1 numbers."
9,Miles Sanders,Eagles,RB,243.0,1061.0,7.0,43.0,359.0,2.0,"It took a while for him to get rolling, but Sanders certainly took command of lead-back duties in Philadelphia during the second half of his rookie season. Sanders put down a solid 179-818-3 rushing line, but where he truly stood out was as a receiver. Sanders' 50-509-3 line was fueled by 8.2 yards per target, which was second best at the position. Sanders didn't play more than 53% of the snaps in a game until Week 11, but he finished 15th among backs in fantasy points. The 23-year-old is primed for a larger share of the workload behind the Eagles' elite offensive line in 2020. Consider him a strong RB2 with upside for more."
10,Austin Ekeler,Chargers,RB,163.0,715.0,4.0,64.0,606.0,3.0,"Ekeler received a contract extension, and former running mate Melvin Gordon is now in Denver, which locks in the former as the Chargers' lead back in 2020. Ekeler took his game to a new level last season, especially as a receiver, ranking no lower than second among backs in targets, receptions, yards and touchdowns. Despite Gordon playing a substantial role in 12 games, Ekeler was fantasy's No. 4 scoring back. Ekeler's small frame will limit his carries and goal-line work (he's never cleared 132 carries or three rushing touchdowns in a season), and he's unlikely to repeat a 91-992-8 receiving line with Tyrod Taylor and Justin Herbert under center. Expect a step back for Ekeler, though his role can still allow borderline RB1 production in PPR."
11,Nick Chubb,Browns,RB,270.0,1267.0,9.0,27.0,210.0,1.0,"Chubb has emerged as one of the league's most-effective rushers since being selected in the second round of the 2018 draft. He ranks first in YPC (5.1) and second in YAC (2.3) among 25 backs with at least 300 carries during that span. Chubb was fantasy's No. 8 scoring back in 2019, thanks to the fourth-most touches and second-most total yardage at the position. However, we can't ignore that Chubb's usage and fantasy production dipped once Kareem Hunt returned from suspension (RB6 before, RB15 after). Hunt will be in the mix from the get-go in 2020, which will certainly limit Chubb's output. Consider Chubb a borderline top-10 RB with more value in non-PPR leagues."
12,Josh Jacobs,Raiders,RB,256.0,1114.0,8.0,36.0,278.0,1.0,"Jacobs returns as the feature back for the Raiders following an extremely impressive rookie campaign. The 2019 first-round pick averaged a healthy 4.75 YPC on 242 attempts and ranked fourth among backs with a 2.25 YAC. Jacobs flashed with four top-10 fantasy weeks but missed three games because of injury, and his output was capped by a limited role as a receiver (27 targets). Coach Jon Gruden has consistently expressed a desire to target Jacobs more often, which adds some optimism that Jacobs can become a workhorse back. Of course, until that actually happens, the 22-year-old is best valued as a fringe top-12 fantasy back."
13,Joe Mixon,Bengals,RB,269.0,1148.0,6.0,38.0,293.0,1.0,"Mixon enters his fourth NFL season as the clear feature back in Cincinnati. The role has allowed Mixon a top-seven finish in touches, top-11 finish in yards and eight-plus touchdowns each of the past two seasons. Despite the heavy usage, a limited role as a pass-catcher has left Mixon with fantasy finishes of 10th and 13th during that span. Mixon is one of the game's better talents at the position, but the Cincinnati offensive line remains a work in progress and his target share is unlikely to see a significant boost with A.J. Green back, Tee Higgins drafted and Giovani Bernard still in the fold. Consider Mixon a borderline top-10 RB."
14,Chris Carson,Seahawks,RB,249.0,1078.0,7.0,36.0,270.0,2.0,"Carson put together another solid season as Seattle's lead back in 2019 and returns atop the depth chart for 2020. The 2017 seventh-round pick has missed a total of three games over the past two seasons but finished fifth in rushing yards during both campaigns. Carson has been of value near the goal line (18 touchdowns) and in terms of efficiency (2.26 YAC is fourth best) during that span. Seattle ramped up Carson's passing-game workload last season, which gives him a better shot at his third-consecutive top-15 fantasy campaign, but the 25-year-old will need to fend off Rashaad Penny and rookie DeeJay Dallas for snaps. Consider Carson a fine RB2 target."
15,Todd Gurley II,Falcons,RB,211.0,856.0,7.0,45.0,373.0,2.0,"Gurley is now the lead back in Atlanta following five seasons with the Rams. The Georgia product was a top-three fantasy RB in both 2017 and 2018, but he handled a lesser workload and struggled badly with efficiency in 2019 while dealing with knee and ankle concerns. After averaging 4.89 YPC (2.11 YAC) on 256 carries and 7.4 yards per target on 78 targets in 14 games in 2018, Gurley's numbers plummeted to 3.84 YPC (1.81 YAC) on 223 carries and 4.2 YPT on 49 targets in 15 games last season. Gurley still managed a 14th-place finish in fantasy points (his fifth top-15 in as many tries), thanks to 14 touchdowns. Gurley's durability is a big concern, but he has little competition for touches in a good offense. He's a fine RB2 target."
16,David Johnson,Texans,RB,230.0,932.0,6.0,39.0,374.0,3.0,"Johnson was one of the league's best backs during his first two seasons, but struggles with injuries and efficiency led to a benching last season and was followed by an offseason trade to Houston. The 28-year-old is well-positioned for a rebound campaign with passing-down specialist Duke Johnson as his only competition for touches. The question is: Is he up for it? Johnson averaged an ugly 3.6 YPC and 1.4 YAC during the past three seasons. He remains an effective receiver but figures to focus primarily on rushing the ball with Duke Johnson in the picture. Johnson can't be counted on as an elite fantasy asset, but he has a path to enough volume to allow midrange RB2 production."
17,Leonard Fournette,Jaguars,RB,214.0,880.0,5.0,55.0,403.0,1.0,"Fournette finally lived up to his first-round pedigree during a breakout 2019 season and locked himself in as one of the league's rare workhorse running backs. During 15 active weeks, Fournette played 88% of the snaps, handling 87% of the carries and 19% of the targets. Fournette finished no lower than seventh among backs in carries, targets, receptions, touches, yards and fantasy points. Fournette's season would've been even more impressive had it not been for some atrocious touchdown luck. Despite a healthy 9.3 OTD (10th highest), Fournette scored three touchdowns. Expect another huge workload, coupled with regression to the mean in the scoring department, to lead to another borderline RB1 campaign for the 25-year-old contract-year back."
18,Le'Veon Bell,Jets,RB,215.0,854.0,4.0,55.0,404.0,2.0,"Despite a healthy dose of turmoil during the 2019 season, Bell is back as the Jets' feature back. Bell's first season in New York saw him rank no lower than 11th among backs in carries, targets, receptions and receiving yards. However, Bell ended up just 16th among backs in fantasy points, due to a low touchdown total (four) and horrific efficiency (3.2 YPC, 5.9 YPT). Bell's heavy volume allowed him a high floor (double-digit points all but one week), but he no longer has an elite ceiling (one weekly finish better than ninth). Bell is now 28 years old and hasn't appeared in 16 regular-season games since 2014. He's no longer an RB1, though an improved Jets offensive line helps his 2020 prospects."
19,Melvin Gordon,Broncos,RB,180.0,722.0,6.0,46.0,361.0,2.0,"Gordon signed on as the Broncos' new lead back, following five seasons with the Chargers. Gordon is fresh off a season when he held out for a month before posting 162-612-8 rushing and 42-296-1 receiving lines. That was enough for the 12th-most fantasy points during that span. Gordon entered 2019 having finished the previous three seasons no lower than ninth in scrimmage yards, sixth in touchdowns and eighth in fantasy points among backs. In Denver's run-heavy offense, Gordon figures to share a chunk of the carries with Phillip Lindsay, but his bigger frame should garner him more goal-line work, and he's also the superior receiver. Gordon is a mid-to-back end RB2."
20,Clyde Edwards-Helaire,Chiefs,RB,171.0,749.0,6.0,39.0,330.0,3.0,"Edwards-Helaire is in running back paradise after Andy Reid and the Chiefs selected him with the 32nd pick of April's draft. The LSU product isn't particularly fast (4.60 40-yard dash) and is on the small side at 5-foot-7, 207 pounds, but he sports elite elusiveness and tackle-breaking ability. Edwards-Helaire also paced this year's rookie class in targets (65), receptions (55) and receiving yards (453) last season. He has three-down upside, though it's possible his frame could cost him goal-line touches. Edwards-Helaire's short-term production might be limited by the presence of Damien Williams, but it's only a matter of time until he's the feature back in the Chiefs' high-scoring, Patrick Mahomes-led offense. He's a borderline top-20 fantasy back in 2020."
21,Kareem Hunt,Browns,RB,86.0,387.0,3.0,56.0,495.0,3.0,"Hunt returns to Cleveland, where he'll operate as a change-of-pace rusher and primary receiving back behind Nick Chubb. Hunt was, of course, one of fantasy's top backs prior to off-field issues leading to roughly one year out of the league. He returned in Week 10 last season and played a substantial role from that point on. Hunt was on the field for 60% of the snaps, handling 5.4 carries and 5.5 targets per game. Hunt was fantasy's No. 17 RB during the stretch and trailed Chubb by only three fantasy points during that span. Chubb will continue to handle most of the carries and goal-line work, but Hunt's role allows him standalone value, not to mention that he's arguably the most valuable handcuff in fantasy."
22,James Conner,Steelers,RB,170.0,721.0,6.0,37.0,285.0,1.0,"Conner returns as the lead back in Pittsburgh, but durability has become a significant concern for a player who has missed at least two games in each of his three NFL seasons. Despite missing three games in 2018, Conner broke out with 1,462 yards and 13 TDs on 269 touches en route to finishing sixth among running backs in fantasy points. He sat ninth at the position through Week 8 last season, but injuries limited him to 54 snaps the rest of the season. A return to full health by Conner and Ben Roethlisberger very well could lead to a bounce-back campaign for the 25-year-old, though he'll need to fend off Benny Snell Jr., Jaylen Samuels and rookie Anthony McFarland Jr. for touches. Consider Conner a flex option."
23,D'Andre Swift,Lions,RB,184.0,769.0,5.0,35.0,283.0,1.0,"The Lions selected Swift with the 35th pick of April's draft. Swift was terrific in Georgia's pro-style offense, producing as both a rusher (440 carries) and receiver (73 receptions) during his three seasons. His efficiency was more solid than spectacular, and he lacks some explosiveness, but he makes up for it with reliability, decent speed (4.48 40-yard dash), quickness and pass-catching prowess. Swift has three-down upside but will begin his career competing for reps with Kerryon Johnson, who figures to focus primarily on ball-carrying, with Swift busier in passing situations. That's likely to limit Swift's fantasy output, but he certainly could flirt with RB2 numbers and is worth a midround pick."
24,Devin Singletary,Bills,RB,176.0,798.0,3.0,41.0,320.0,1.0,"An injury may have limited Singletary's early-season contributions during his rookie campaign, but the 2019 third-round pick quickly overtook Frank Gore upon his return. During Weeks 8-16, Singletary handled a generous 14.9 carries and 4.0 targets per game. He was held to three touchdowns but was ninth among RBs in scrimmage yards, while playing 74% of the snaps during that span. Though he struggled after contact, Singletary's 5.1 YPC was sixth best among backs. Singletary is expected to work as the lead back again this season, but his 5-foot-7, 203-pound frame will limit his volume. Expect rookie Zack Moss to be heavily involved, along with Josh Allen, at the goal line. Singletary may struggle to clear a half-dozen touchdowns but will get enough work to flirt with top-20 production."
25,Jonathan Taylor,Colts,RB,198.0,852.0,7.0,24.0,204.0,1.0,"The Colts surprisingly nabbed Taylor with the 41st pick of April's draft. An outstanding prospect purely from a rushing standpoint, the Wisconsin product paced this year's rookie class in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns and ranked fourth with a 3.7 YAC in 2019. Taylor also crushed it at February's combine, running a position-best 4.39 40 and a solid 7.01 three cone despite a hefty 5-foot-10, 226-pound frame. The main concerns here are fumbles (18) and pass-catching ability (nine drops on 68 targets). Taylor has RB1 upside down the road, but his short-term fantasy value will suffer with incumbent early-down back Marlon Mack and passing-down specialist Nyheim Hines in the fold. Taylor is worth grabbing in the middle rounds, but it might take some time before he's a reliable fantasy starter."
26,Tarik Cohen,Bears,RB,69.0,292.0,1.0,72.0,511.0,2.0,"Cohen returns as Chicago's change-of-pace and extremely-busy receiving back. Believe it or not, Cohen ranks fourth among backs in both targets (261) and receptions (203) since entering the NFL in 2017. Cohen's 190-pound frame has limited him to no more than 99 carries in a single season and a grand total of four carries inside the 5-yard line. However, 70-plus catches each of the past two seasons has helped him to fantasy finishes of 11th in 2018 and 27th in 2019. Cohen's efficiency was extremely poor last season (3.3 YPC, 4.4 YPT), and he'll remain limited as a rusher and at the goal line, but his role isn't expected to change in 2020, which locks him into the PPR flex discussion."
27,David Montgomery,Bears,RB,213.0,853.0,6.0,26.0,217.0,1.0,"Montgomery's rookie season didn't go as planned, but the 2019 third-round pick remains atop the Chicago depth chart. The Iowa State product wasn't short on volume in his first season, ranking 12th among backs in touches and sixth in carries inside the 5 (14). The problem was a combination of poor rushing efficiency (3.7 YPC, 1.6 YAC) and a lack of volume and effectiveness as a pass-catcher (185 yards on 37 targets). The end result was two top-15 fantasy weeks and a 24th-place finish by season's end. Montgomery will continue to defer passing-down work to Tarik Cohen but is certainly a breakout candidate in his second season. Montgomery is a flex option with RB2 upside."
28,Mark Ingram II,Ravens,RB,159.0,737.0,7.0,23.0,184.0,1.0,"Volume is king in fantasy football, but Ingram did his best to be the exception to that rule during his first season as Baltimore's lead back. Despite handling only 37% of the team's carries and 7% of the targets, Ingram was fantasy's No. 11 scoring RB, thanks to the Ravens' high-scoring offense. Ingram ranked 22nd in touches and 15th in scrimmage yards, but his 15 touchdowns ranked fourth. An injury-plagued 2018 season aside, Ingram has been a top-15 fantasy RB each season since 2014. Despite the positivity, it will be hard to count on a repeat from Ingram in 2020. He's now 30, which means his volume is unlikely to rise (especially with J.K. Dobbins now in the mix), he plays a minimal role as a receiver and the Baltimore offense figures to regress in scoring. Ingram is a fringe RB2 with a low ceiling."
29,Ke'Shawn Vaughn,Buccaneers,RB,158.0,663.0,5.0,32.0,245.0,1.0,"The Buccaneers selected Vaughn with a third-round pick in April's draft. The Vanderbilt product's FBS efficiency was impressive, as he posted the third-best YAC/forced missed tackle profile in 2019 for this year's rookie class. Vaughn is more fast (4.51 40-yard dash) than quick and is a tough 5-foot-10, 214 pounds. He has the size and ability to quickly contribute as a rusher, as a receiver and at the goal line. He'll compete with Ronald Jones for carries and Dare Ogunbowale for targets right away in the new-look Buccaneers' offense. Vaughn's most likely role is as a committee back in 2020, but he has a clear path to lead back duties if he overtakes Jones. Vaughn will be well worth a mid-to-late-round draft pick."
30,Kerryon Johnson,Lions,RB,172.0,694.0,6.0,26.0,215.0,1.0,"Johnson enters his third NFL season no longer a clear feature back after Detroit drafted D'Andre Swift in the second round. Johnson impressed as a second-round rookie in 2018, averaging 5.4 YPC and catching 84% of his targets, but missed six games. During another injury-plagued campaign in 2019, his receiving workload and rushing efficiency took a hard hit (3.6 YPC) in eight games as Detroit's primary rusher, though he was providing RB2 production prior to a Week 7 injury. Johnson is only 23 years old, but the presence of the more-dynamic Swift is sure to limit his touches. Consider Johnson a flex with limited upside."
31,Ronald Jones II,Buccaneers,RB,174.0,721.0,5.0,28.0,216.0,1.0,"Following what was a disastrous rookie season in 2018, Jones added weight and got his career back on track with an impressive showing in 2019. After totaling 77 yards on 30 touches in 2018, Jones produced 1,003 yards and six touchdowns on 203 touches last season. Despite his second-round pedigree and superior play relative to his counterparts in the Tampa Bay backfield, Jones was limited to only 37% of the snaps and 47% of the designed runs. It's very possible we've yet to see the best of Jones, as he was drafted very young and is entering his age-23 season. In fact, he's three months younger than his new competition for targets, third-round pick Ke'Shawn Vaughn. Jones is a fine flex target with more value in non-PPR leagues."
32,Jordan Howard,Dolphins,RB,174.0,747.0,6.0,25.0,187.0,1.0,"Howard signed with the Dolphins following four seasons with Chicago and Philadelphia. The 2016 fifth-round pick has racked up 3,895 rushing yards in his four pro seasons, which trails only the totals of Ezekiel Elliott and Todd Gurley for most during that span. Howard is obviously a very effective rusher but has struggled as a receiver, averaging an ugly 5.4 yards per play on 119 career targets. A top-20 fantasy back during his first three seasons, Howard might struggle to get back to that territory as he operates as an early-down and goal-line complement to Matt Breida in Miami. The 25-year-old hammer is a borderline flex option in non-PPR leagues."
33,Derrius Guice,FA,RB,142.0,604.0,5.0,34.0,278.0,1.0,"Guice is entering his third NFL season but has only five games of experience due to multiple knee injuries. The 2018 second-round pick missed his entire rookie season with a torn ACL prior to showing fairly well with 324 yards and a pair of scores on 49 touches last season (5.8 YPC, 7.9 YPT). A healthy Guice figures to get the first shot at leading the Washington backfield, but Adrian Peterson, Antonio Gibson, Peyton Barber, J.D. McKissic and former Stanford star Bryce Love are also on the roster. Guice is only 23 years old and has massive upside, but he's a risky investment. He's best viewed as a borderline flex."
34,Raheem Mostert,49ers,RB,159.0,741.0,7.0,18.0,159.0,1.0,"It's not often you see a running back break out in his fifth NFL campaign, but Mostert did exactly that down the stretch last season. Primarily a special-teams player throughout his career, Mostert put up 859 yards and scored 13 touchdowns on 133 touches during the 49ers' final nine games of 2019 (including the playoffs). An extremely efficient runner, Mostert is averaging 6.0 YPC on 178 regular-season carries for his career, which is easily best among 188 RBs with 150-plus carries. The concerns here are that Mostert plays a minimal pass-catching role (22 targets last season) and Kyle Shanahan is very unpredictable with his backfield rotation. As such, Mostert is best viewed as a flex with RB2 upside."
35,James White,Patriots,RB,59.0,252.0,2.0,54.0,487.0,3.0,"White has finished as a top-20 fantasy RB each of the past two seasons, but he's a bit of a wild card now that old reliable Tom Brady is out of the picture. We can't bank on carries from White (he has never cleared 94 in a single season), but he has ranked no lower than sixth among backs in targets, catches, receiving yards and touchdown receptions each of the past two seasons. White is a strong bet to remain New England's primary passing-down back, but we can't assume Cam Newton or Jarrett Stidham will target him as often, and the safe bet would be to expect less scoring and a more run-heavy approach from the Patriots' offense. White still has PPR value, but he's more of a fringe flex with a limited ceiling."
36,Phillip Lindsay,Broncos,RB,164.0,731.0,4.0,31.0,206.0,1.0,"Lindsay is back in Denver for his third NFL season, but the team's former lead back now figures to settle in as an oft-used change-of-pace runner behind newcomer Melvin Gordon. It's not often you get immediate production from an undrafted player, but Lindsay has produced a pair of 1,000-yard rushing seasons since Denver signed him after the 2018 draft. Lindsay has certainly flashed as a rusher (4.9 career YPC), but he has struggled to produce after contact (1.6 YAC) and as a receiver (4.5 YPT), which explains the team's interest in Gordon. Lindsay's reduced role means he likely won't post his third consecutive top-20 fantasy season, but the 26-year-old is on the flex radar, especially in non-PPR leagues."
37,Cam Akers,Rams,RB,170.0,708.0,7.0,22.0,180.0,1.0,"The Rams selected Akers with the 52nd pick of April's draft. The tough and elusive Akers measures in at 5-foot-10, 217 pounds with solid speed (4.47 40-yard dash) and good strength (20 bench reps). Despite lacking some big-play ability and having to do most of his damage after contact last season (5.0 YPC, 1.7 YBC), Akers posted one of the best YAC/forced missed tackle profiles in this year's rookie class. The Florida State product will open his career in a wide-open competition with second-year back Darrell Henderson and Malcolm Brown to replace Todd Gurley. He might not do much as a receiver, but if Akers is able to claim a majority of the carries and goal-line work, he could quickly join the RB2 discussion. Grab him in the middle rounds."
38,Darrell Henderson Jr.,Rams,RB,127.0,525.0,4.0,35.0,291.0,1.0,"Henderson will get a shot at earning lead-back duties in the Rams' backfield this season following the release of Todd Gurley. Henderson was initially expected to play a significant change-of-pace role behind Gurley last season but instead was limited to 39 carries and six targets on 89 snaps. The Rams selected Henderson in the third round of the 2019 draft after he averaged 8.9 YPC (seriously!) on 344 carries during his final two seasons at Memphis. Henderson has tremendous upside as a rusher, and his passing-down chops make him a candidate for weekly PPR value, but he'll be hard-pressed to separate himself from rookie Cam Akers (and perhaps Malcolm Brown) as the team's clear feature back. Nonetheless, Henderson is a second-year breakout candidate and borderline flex option."
39,Boston Scott,Eagles,RB,126.0,524.0,6.0,31.0,229.0,1.0,"With the Eagles all but out of wide receivers late last season, they turned to 2018 sixth-round pick Scott in desperation. The undersized Louisiana Tech product delivered the goods. Scott put up 245 yards and five touchdowns on 61 carries and caught 24 of 27 targets for 204 yards. Scott played a grand total of 35 career offensive snaps prior to handling 146 during the Eagles' final four regular-season games. Only six backs scored more fantasy points during that span. The Eagles' offense will be healthier, and Scott will work behind Miles Sanders, but the Darren Sproles doppelganger figures to see enough runs to flirt with PPR flex production."
40,Nyheim Hines,Colts,RB,53.0,218.0,2.0,52.0,422.0,2.0,"Marlon Mack and Jonathan Taylor are the Colts' primary ball carriers, but it's Hines who has been handling passing situations. The 2018 fourth-round pick ranked eighth among backs in routes and seventh in targets with Andrew Luck in 2018 before falling to 27th and 16th, respectively, with Jacoby Brissett last season. Hines' receiving efficiency has been a problem (career 5.3 YPT and nine drops), and his 190-pound frame hasn't allowed him much volume or efficiency as a rusher (3.7 YPC on 137 career carries) or in the scoring department (six career TDs). Perhaps Philip Rivers will inject some life into Hines' fantasy stock, but the third-year back will need to significantly improve his game. He's worth only a late flier in PPR."
41,Damien Williams,Chiefs,RB,88.0,397.0,5.0,30.0,240.0,2.0,"Williams is back in Kansas City this season, but he'll have a lot more competition this time around after the Chiefs selected Clyde Edwards-Helaire with 32nd-overall pick of April's draft. The rookie is sure to limit Williams' fantasy upside but flex value remains a possibility. Consider: Williams has played at least 49% of the snaps in 16 games since joining the team in 2018. He has handled 13.3 carries and 5.3 targets per game during those weeks, which has allowed him 278 touches for 1,534 yards and 21 TDs. His numbers add up to 340.4 fantasy points, which would've ranked second to only Christian McCaffrey last season. Williams' size edge on Edwards-Helaire could lead to primary goal-line work, and 10-12 touches per game in this elite offense is nothing to sneeze at. Consider Williams in the middle rounds."
42,Duke Johnson,Texans,RB,68.0,314.0,1.0,44.0,387.0,2.0,"After spending 2019 as a passing-down complement to Carlos Hyde, Johnson is expected to play a similar role behind newcomer David Johnson this season. Johnson has yet to convince a coaching staff that he's worthy of a three-down role, as he has managed only 76 carries per season since entering the league in 2015. Although his targets have dipped the past two seasons, Johnson has been in the upper two thirds in yards per target all five seasons, and his 4.1 OTD (expected TD total) paced the position last season. Johnson's role severely limits his ceiling, and it's possible that he will lose targets to David Johnson this season. Consider the 26-year-old a weak flex in PPR leagues."
43,Latavius Murray,Saints,RB,132.0,547.0,5.0,26.0,192.0,1.0,"Murray is now 30 years old, but he remains in a good spot as Alvin Kamara's backup in a high-scoring Saints' offense. In his first season in New Orleans, Murray was held to 98 touches and the 49th-most fantasy points among backs during the 14 weeks Kamara was also active. However, with Kamara sidelined during Weeks 7 and 8, Murray stepped in and racked up 307 yards and four touchdowns on 60 touches. He was fantasy's top-scoring RB in that span. Murray lacks stand-alone value but is obviously an elite handcuff."
44,J.K. Dobbins,Ravens,RB,134.0,593.0,4.0,25.0,206.0,1.0,"Baltimore grabbed its lead running back of the future by selecting Dobbins with a second-round pick in April's draft. Dobbins is an outstanding athlete with terrific speed, balance and playmaking ability. He sports a 5-foot-9, 209-pound frame and is a three-down option with the ability to contribute as an impact rusher and receiver. In his final season at Ohio State, Dobbins' 2,003 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns tied for tops in this year's rookie class. His 3.5 YAC was sixth. Landing in Baltimore's high-scoring offense sets up Dobbins with a massive long-term ceiling, but he's likely to be utilized as a change-of-pace back in the short term, with Mark Ingram, Gus Edwards and second-year Justice Hill also on the roster. Dobbins won't have much early-season fantasy value but will be a strong end-of-bench stash during the 2020 season."
45,Justin Jackson,Chargers,RB,135.0,572.0,4.0,27.0,201.0,1.0,"Jackson is positioned for a run at a breakout 2020 season following Melvin Gordon's departure to Denver. Jackson will compete with rookie Joshua Kelley for No. 2 duties behind Austin Ekeler, with the latter unlikely to handle a workhorse role at 5-foot-9, 195 pounds. That positions Jackson with an opportunity for roughly 10-12 touches per game and perhaps primary goal-line duties. The 2018 seventh-round pick has been effective on 79 career carries, averaging 5.1 YPC (2.2 YAC). Jackson is worth a late flier in deep leagues but can be ignored if he falls behind Kelley."
46,Marlon Mack,Colts,RB,154.0,676.0,5.0,16.0,126.0,1.0,"Mack is back with the Colts after ranking top-10 in carries, rushing yards and rushing TDs last season. However, he can be considered a lock for a reduced role after the team drafted Jonathan Taylor in the second round. That's a problem for a player who, despite reaching 900 rushing yards and eight touchdowns each of the past two seasons, has still yet to post a top-20 fantasy campaign. There are two primary culprits: injuries (he has missed at least two games in each of his three NFL seasons) and a minimal workload as a receiver (31 total catches during the past two seasons). Mack may catch a few extra passes with Philip Rivers in town, but Taylor and Nyheim Hines will be major factors. Mack benefits from the Colts' elite offensive line but may struggle for flex value in his new situation."
47,Tevin Coleman,49ers,RB,131.0,541.0,5.0,18.0,178.0,1.0,"Coleman opened the 2019 season as the 49ers' lead back but was all but replaced atop the depth chart by Raheem Mostert down the stretch and during the playoffs. Coleman returns to San Francisco in 2020 but simply can't be counted on as a reliable starter. On one hand, it's a good situation, as 49ers' backs led the NFL in rushing yards (2,051) and touchdowns (19) last season. On the other hand, Jimmy Garoppolo didn't target the position much (20th in the category), and job security is almost nonexistent in Kyle Shanahan's offense. Coleman will compete with Mostert and Jerick McKinnon for snaps. Consider him a bench option with handcuff appeal."
48,Sony Michel,Patriots,RB,184.0,722.0,5.0,11.0,92.0,0.0,"Michel remains New England's lead rusher as he enters his third professional season, but this offense certainly has a different feel to it with Tom Brady out of the picture. Thus far, Michel has essentially been limited to a situational, between-the-tackles hammer role. In 29 regular-season games, he has played 37% of the snaps and handled 54% of the carries (15.7 per game) and 3% of the targets (1.1 per game). That usage allowed Michel only two top-20 fantasy weeks in 2019. Perhaps New England will lean more on its 2018 first-round pick with Brady gone, but with his nonexistent role as a receiver and with James White, Rex Burkhead and Damien Harris in the fold, Michel should be viewed as only a flex option in non-PPR leagues."
49,Matt Breida,Dolphins,RB,109.0,499.0,1.0,35.0,277.0,1.0,"Breida was traded to the Dolphins and is expected to share backfield duties with Jordan Howard this season. The former 49ers' rotational back has at least 105 carries in each of his three NFL seasons and has ranked no lower than 13th in yards per carry in each of those campaigns. His 5.0 YPC in that span ranks third among 42 backs with 300-plus carries. Breida hasn't done much after contact (1.5 YAC) or as a receiver (91 career targets) but has shown to be an explosive playmaker, which makes the 190-pound back a terrific complement to the 230-pound Howard. Consider Breida a bench option with a shot at flex production."
50,Zack Moss,Bills,RB,143.0,613.0,4.0,19.0,148.0,1.0,"The Bills selected Moss with a third-round pick in April's draft. Moss is an elite prospect in two key areas: YAC (second-best in this year's rookie class in 2019) and forced missed tackles (second). The Utah product has terrific size (5-foot-9, 223 pounds) and the balance, toughness, quickness and receiving ability to emerge as one of the game's top backs, though speed is a major concern following his 4.65 40-yard dash at the combine. Moss joins Devin Singletary in the Bills' backfield. The two figure to limit each other's fantasy output, though the rookie has 20 pounds on his new teammate, which could vault him into a significant role on early downs and at the goal line. Moss could flirt with the flex radar and is a fine mid-round target."
51,Jamaal Williams,Packers,RB,85.0,351.0,2.0,33.0,253.0,2.0,"Williams returns as a backup rusher and passing-down contributor in Green Bay, though he'll face more competition for work this season, with second-round pick AJ Dillon in the fold. In 13 full games last season, Williams was well behind Aaron Jones in carries (179 to 107) but was basically even in targets (46 to 45). Jones was a top-five fantasy RB in those 13 weeks, though it might surprise you to know that Williams was 24th. There are plenty of fantasy points to be had in the Packers' backfield, but Williams, who has yet to post a top-30 fantasy campaign, might not even be the team's lead back if Jones gets injured. He's barely worthy of a draft pick in most formats."
52,Antonio Gibson,FA,RB,52.0,235.0,1.0,36.0,352.0,1.0,"Washington selected Gibson with the 66th pick of April's draft. Gibson enters the league as more of an 'offensive weapon' than a wide receiver or running back, but early comparisons to Christian McCaffrey by head coach Ron Rivera suggest he'll focus primarily on the latter. The Memphis product is big (6-foot, 228 pounds) and a terrific athlete with excellent power, speed (4.39 40-yard dash) and elusiveness. He's a terror with the ball in his hands, having averaged 8.4 yards per carry and 13.1 yards per target (11.9 RAC) in 2019. Experience is a concern here (33 carries and 66 targets in two FBS seasons), but the shaky wide receiver depth chart behind Terry McLaurin suggests Gibson will, at least, get plenty of work as a pass catcher. He's unlikely to provide consistent flex numbers early on but is a fine upside flier."
53,Jaylen Samuels,Steelers,RB,41.0,167.0,1.0,41.0,301.0,2.0,"Samuels returns as a passing-down specialist in Pittsburgh. The 2018 fifth-rounder entered the league as an H-Back but has made some slight noise in fantasy in relief of the oft-injured James Conner. Samuels doesn't see enough work to allow stand-alone value, and even if Conner were to miss time, Pittsburgh doesn't seem interested in Samuels as anything more than a situational rusher (he has 56 and 66 carries, respectively, in his two seasons). Samuels will have his hands full beating Conner, Benny Snell Jr. and rookie Anthony McFarland Jr. for snaps this season. He's no more than a late-round flier in deep PPR leagues."
54,Tony Pollard,Cowboys,RB,83.0,364.0,2.0,26.0,205.0,1.0,"Pollard remains Ezekiel Elliott's primary backup as he enters his second NFL season. The 2019 fourth-round pick generated some hype last offseason during Elliott's holdout but ended up touching the ball only 101 times during his rookie campaign. Pollard showed well ' he averaged 5.3 YPC, and his 2.7 YAC was tops in the league ' but didn't see the field much, with Elliott appearing in all 16 games. Pollard is unlikely to produce stand-alone value, but he has the size and skill set to take on a substantial chunk of Elliott's workload, should Elliott miss time. Stash Pollard on your bench."
55,Alexander Mattison,Vikings,RB,118.0,495.0,3.0,16.0,132.0,1.0,"Mattison enters his second NFL season in the same position he was in as a rookie: Dalvin Cook's handcuff. The 2019 third-round pick impressed in his first season, producing 544 yards on 110 touches. Mattison averaged 4.6 YPC despite facing an average of 7.3 in-box defenders, highest in the NFL. Mattison is entering his age-22 season without much stand-alone value, but there's no doubt that he would vault to RB1 territory in the event of a Dalvin Cook injury in Minnesota's run-heavy scheme. Draft him, and stash him."
56,Darrynton Evans,Titans,RB,92.0,377.0,2.0,22.0,171.0,1.0,"Dion Lewis is out and Evans ' a 2020 third-round pick ' is in as Derrick Henry's backup in Tennessee. Evans is on the small side at 5-foot-10, 203 pounds but showed well at the combine with a 4.41 40-yard dash and an above-average performance in every drill in which he took part. In terms of production, Evans followed a very efficient 2018 campaign with a boost in volume but a dip in efficiency in 2019. His forced missed tackle/YAC profile was poor this past season, but his combination of speed, ball protection (two career fumbles) and receiving ability suggests he'll be a fine complementary back. Evans will be an intriguing handcuff stash in 2020 but won't have standalone value."
57,Jerick McKinnon,49ers,RB,85.0,318.0,2.0,24.0,189.0,1.0,"McKinnon signed a pricy contract with San Francisco prior to the 2018 season but has yet to play a snap for the team due to injury. Following a contract restructure, McKinnon will attempt another comeback in 2020. Even prior to the injury struggles, the 5-foot-9, 212-pound McKinnon had never exceeded 159 carries in a season and averaged 3.59 YPC (worst among backs), including 1.50 after contact (second worst) on 309 carries during the 2016 and 2017 seasons. McKinnon's receiving volume has been terrific, but his efficiency has been weak (5.2 YPT). The 49ers' run-heavy offense is attractive, but McKinnon's lengthy absence and the presences of Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman make fantasy relevance a long shot."
58,Giovani Bernard,Bengals,RB,63.0,261.0,1.0,28.0,220.0,1.0,"Bernard is a change-of-pace and passing-down complement to Joe Mixon in Cincinnati. The 28-year-old has been a solid presence throughout his seven-year NFL career, but his fantasy contributions have declined significantly the past four seasons. A top-20 back in both targets and fantasy points in his first three seasons, Bernard ranked 32nd in targets in 2020 and has one top-40 fantasy season in the past four campaigns. Bernard would need a Mixon injury to approach fantasy relevance, and even then, he's likely to operate in a timeshare."
59,Jalen Richard,Raiders,RB,52.0,236.0,1.0,29.0,243.0,1.0,"Richard is the passing-down complement to Josh Jacobs in Las Vegas. Richard broke out with 68 receptions for 607 yards in 2018, but his usage was nearly cut in half (36-323) with Jacobs in the mix last season. Despite a 5.0 career YPC, Richard hasn't cleared 56 carries in a season since 2016, and the Raiders appear committed to Jacobs' taking on an even larger role as a receiver in 2020. Especially with third-round pick Lynn Bowden likely to steal the occasional touch, Richard is worth a look in only the deepest of PPR leagues."
60,Ito Smith,Falcons,RB,61.0,248.0,2.0,24.0,182.0,1.0,"Following two seasons behind Devonta Freeman, Smith is expected to operate as Todd Gurley's primary backup in Atlanta this season. Smith struggled with effectiveness (3.5 YPC, 4.8 YPT) on 117 touches as a fourth-round rookie in 2018 and was limited by injury to 33 touches in seven games last season. The 195-pound scat back would need a Gurley injury to find his way into a backfield committee. He's an uninspiring handcuff with no stand-alone value."
61,Chase Edmonds,Cardinals,RB,69.0,298.0,2.0,17.0,129.0,1.0,"Edmonds is expected to enter the 2020 season as Kenyan Drake's primary backup. The third-year back has operated as a reserve in 28 of 29 career games, but the one exception was an explosive Week 7 effort against the Giants last season in which he put up 150 yards and three scores on 29 touches. Edmonds went on to touch the ball nine times the rest of the season while dealing with injuries and the emergence of Drake. Edmonds' handcuff status is all but secured with David Johnson no longer in the mix (seventh-round pick Eno Benjamin is his chief competition), so though the 24-year-old has no stand-alone value, he's a valuable handcuff and thus worth a stash in deeper leagues."
62,Rashaad Penny,Seahawks,RB,66.0,292.0,2.0,14.0,112.0,1.0,"A 2018 first-round pick, Penny's contributions have thus far been limited by the combination of his injuries and the standout play of Chris Carson. The good news is that the San Diego State product has been very effective when called upon. Penny's 5.26 YPC ranks third, and his 2.05 YAC ranks 11th among 52 RBs with 150 carries since he entered the league. Penny forced his way into an expanded role and appeared on the verge of a breakout with rushing lines of 14-129-1 and 15-74-1 during Weeks 12 and 13 last season, but a Week 14 injury ended his season prematurely. The injury could lead to a stint on the PUP list to open 2020, but Penny is only 24 and remains an intriguing post-hype target. If a Week 1 return appears likely, he'll be well worth a late-round flier in Seattle's high-scoring offense."
63,Adrian Peterson,FA,RB,80.0,327.0,2.0,13.0,101.0,0.0,"Peterson is back in Washington, though he'll have a ton of competition for touches this time around, courtesy of Derrius Guice, Antonio Gibson, Bryce Love, J.D. McKissic and Peyton Barber. With Guice out most of 2019, Peterson ranked 17th among running backs with 898 rushing yards but didn't score much (five TDs) and was a nonfactor as a receiver (23 targets). Peterson is still an effective rusher at age 35, but the reigning No. 33 scoring fantasy back is a strong bet for a significant decrease in touches in 2020. He shouldn't be on your draft radar."
64,Anthony McFarland Jr.,Steelers,RB,89.0,368.0,2.0,9.0,68.0,0.0,"Pittsburgh drafted McFarland in the fourth round of April's draft. McFarland is a bit undersized (5-foot-8, 208 pounds) and coming off a disappointing 2019 season at Maryland, when he was hampered by an ankle injury. McFarland impressed in 2018 with 1,034 yards in 131 carries (7.9 YPC) but saw his production dip to 614 yards in 114 carries (5.4 YPC) in 2019. An ugly 26% of his 2019 rushes resulted in a loss of yards, which was worst in the class. McFarland's 4.44 speed is intriguing, but he has a short r'sum', especially as a receiver (33 career targets). He'll compete with Jaylen Samuels and Benny Snell for snaps behind James Conner and is only a handcuff target in deeper leagues."
65,Joshua Kelley,Chargers,RB,78.0,318.0,2.0,11.0,86.0,0.0,"The Chargers selected Kelley in the fourth round of April's draft. Kelley is 5-foot-11, 212 pounds and immediately steps in as competition for Justin Jackson (5-foot-11, 200 pounds) as an early-down complement to the 5-foot-9, 195-pound Austin Ekeler. Kelley's efficiency was weak on 229 carries and 17 targets at UCLA last season, but it was much better in 2018, and he showed very well athletically at the combine. That included a 4.49 40-yard dash and a position-best 6.95 three cone. Kelley is a physical, downhill rusher who could sneak into rookie season fantasy value if he beats Jackson. Take a late flier."
66,Rex Burkhead,Patriots,RB,37.0,157.0,1.0,20.0,183.0,1.0,"Burkhead returns to a crowded backfield in New England that includes Sony Michel, James White, Damien Harris and Brandon Bolden. Burkhead is entering his age-30 season having never cleared 74 carries or 38 targets in a season. His best fantasy finish was 39th in 2017. Burkhead would need multiple injuries to emerge as a reliable weekly fantasy starter, and even then, he might not be overly appealing with Tom Brady no longer under center. Burkhead is worth a look only in the deepest of leagues."
67,Chris Thompson,Jaguars,RB,37.0,162.0,1.0,21.0,179.0,1.0,No outlook available.
68,Dion Lewis,Giants,RB,60.0,245.0,1.0,17.0,118.0,1.0,"Lewis signed with the Giants during the offseason and is expected to work as Saquon Barkley's primary backup. The 29-year-old's best fantasy season was a 13th-place finish with the Patriots in 2017, though his efficiency hasn't been nearly as good the past two seasons in Tennessee. Lewis will get the occasional change-of-pace carry and spell Barkley in occasional passing situations, but the journeyman will need an injury to push for 15-plus touches. Lewis is a fine handcuff stash."
69,Damien Harris,Patriots,RB,79.0,328.0,2.0,8.0,65.0,0.0,"Harris enters his second NFL season as part of a crowded New England backfield that includes Sony Michel, James White, Rex Burkhead and Brandon Bolden. A third-round pick last offseason, Harris was limited to five snaps during his rookie campaign. He lacks top-end speed (4.57 40-yard dash) but has decent size (5-foot-10, 216 pounds) and is a powerful, downhill runner with exceptional ball security (zero fumbles in 2018). He's also a good pass-catcher and blocker, which supplies him with three-down upside in the pros. Harris is buried in New England, but one injury could vault him into a big role. He's an end-of-bench stash at best."
70,AJ Dillon,Packers,RB,70.0,292.0,2.0,8.0,65.0,0.0,"The Packers selected Dillon with a second-round pick in April's draft. Dillon is one of the biggest backs in this class, at 6-foot, 247 pounds. The Boston College product is a powerful, downhill rusher who isn't particularly dynamic and doesn't figure to offer much as a receiver (21 receptions in 35 games at BC). Dillon showed very well athletically at the combine, posting impressive marks in the 40-yard dash (4.53), vertical (41) and broad jump (131). He might eventually be a difference-maker but will open 2020 buried behind Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams. Both veteran backs are entering contract years, so Dillon could emerge as the Packers' lead back as soon as 2021. He should be valued as an end-of-bench handcuff in 2020 leagues."

73,Carlos Hyde,Seahawks,RB,72.0,300.0,2.0,8.0,49.0,0.0,"Hyde is a free agent following stops with the 49ers, Jaguars, Chiefs and Texans during his first six NFL campaigns. Hyde's pro career appeared to be on the brink after he was the odd man out in Kansas City last fall, but the veteran back got back on track with Houston, ranking 11th in the league with 245 carries. Hyde averaged a healthy 4.4 YPC and scored six touchdowns, but a minimal role as a receiver (16 targets) limited him to a 30th-place finish in fantasy points. He's now 28 years old."
74,Reggie Bonnafon,Panthers,RB,46.0,190.0,1.0,14.0,109.0,0.0,No outlook available.
75,Lynn Bowden Jr.,Raiders,RB,28.0,126.0,1.0,16.0,145.0,1.0,"The Raiders selected Bowden with a third-round pick in April's draft. Bowden is about as versatile a weapon as you'll come across, with 74 pass attempts, 206 rushes and 114 receptions on his resume during three seasons at Kentucky. Bowden is on the small side (5-foot-11, 204 pounds), lacks speed and has struggled with drops (10 the past two seasons) and fumbles (nine in 2019). His versatility and big-play ability are intriguing but might not translate to consistent fantasy production. He does not have a path to an every-down role in Las Vegas in the short term, with Josh Jacobs and Jalen Richard locking down running back and Henry Ruggs, Hunter Renfrow and Tyrell Williams set to soak up most wide receiver snaps. Bowden won't be worth a fantasy pick in 2020, but he will be a fun stash in dynasty."
76,Gus Edwards,Ravens,RB,74.0,341.0,2.0,4.0,30.0,0.0,"Edwards was the second man up for carries behind Mark Ingram last season, but he could fall to third this season with second-round pick J.K. Dobbins in the mix. The backup gig was generous to Edwards in 2019, as it allowed him 133 carries in the league's highest-scoring offense. Edwards is a nonfactor in the passing game (he has 270 carries and 10 targets in two seasons), but his rushing efficiency has been nothing short of elite. In fact, Edwards' career 5.3 YPC is best among 40 backs with 200-plus carries since he entered the league as an undrafted free agent in 2018. Edwards can no longer be considered Ingram's clear handcuff, and even if Ingram misses time, Edwards would work in a timeshare with Dobbins and perhaps Justice Hill. Edwards is worth a pick only in deep non-PPR leagues."
77,La'Mical Perine,Jets,RB,45.0,183.0,1.0,12.0,91.0,0.0,"The Jets selected Perine with a fourth-round pick during April's draft. The former Florida Gator checks in with good size at 5-foot-11, 216 pounds and profiles as a solid committee back with the ability to contribute as a pass-catcher and blocker. Perine never cleared 136 carries in a season at Florida but caught 40 passes last season. His 10 1/4-inch hands were biggest among backs at the combine, and his wingspan ranked among the largest. Perine has some limitations in terms of elusiveness and speed (4.62 40-yard dash), and while he could settle in as a third-down/receiving back in the pros, he'll compete with Frank Gore to be Le'Veon Bell's top backup for 2020. That certainly puts him on the handcuff radar in deeper leagues."

80,Ryquell Armstead,Jaguars,RB,50.0,206.0,1.0,8.0,69.0,0.0,"Armstead enters his second professional season as the primary backup to Leonard Fournette. The 2019 fifth-round pick produced 108 yards on 35 carries (3.1 YPC, 1.9 YAC) and 144 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 24 targets (6.0 YPT) off the bench as a rookie. Fournette was the topic of trade rumors during the offseason, so if he gets moved, Armstead will be a more appealing fantasy asset. In the meantime, however, he's no more than a handcuff option in deeper leagues."
81,Malcolm Brown,Rams,RB,39.0,157.0,2.0,7.0,55.0,0.0,"With Todd Gurley out of the picture in Los Angeles, Brown will compete with second-year Darrell Henderson and rookie Cam Akers for touches in the Rams' backfield. Brown is entering his sixth NFL season having yet to eclipse 69 carries or 11 targets in a campaign. Brown could factor in on early downs and near the goal line (he's 224 pounds and scored five touchdowns last season) but is a long shot for anything more than situational duties and is unlikely to factor in as a receiver. Consider him for your bench in deep leagues."

Love had the look of an emerging superstar after he broke out for 2,118 rushing yards (8.1 YPC) and 19 touchdowns in 2017. The wheels fell off from there, as his 2018 season began with a drop in production and ended with the knee injury. Love is undersized (5-foot-9, 200 pounds), but he sports good speed, elusiveness and tackle-breaking ability. He has big upside if able to return to 2017 form, but it might take some time for him to see the field with Derrius Guice, Antonio Gibson, Adrian Peterson, J.D. McKissic and Peyton Barber in the mix in Washington. Take a late flier on Love in very deep and dynasty leagues."

The former Raiders' reserve will compete with Darwin Thompson and Darrel Williams for touches behind top backs Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Damien Williams. Washington would need multiple injuries to find his way to a substantial role, though it would come in one of the league's best situations for a back. Washington, who racked up 1,735 yards on 370 touches in four seasons in Oakland, should be on watch lists but doesn't need to be drafted."

Freeman's stock took another hit this past offseason, when Denver signed Melvin Gordon. Freeman's rushing efficiency hasn't been good (3.8 YPC, 1.7 YAC last season), but he supplied a reliable set of hands with the position's third-best catch rate (86%) on 50 targets last season. Freeman needs two injuries to find his way to fantasy relevance in 2020 and shouldn't be drafted."

Hill was active for all 16 of Baltimore's regular-season games as a rookie, but the fourth-round pick was limited to 66 touches on 181 snaps. Interestingly, Hill was targeted four times in Week 16 before he paced the backfield in snaps (46), pass routes (38) and targets (five) in the playoff loss to Tennessee. Hill's expanded role in passing situations down the stretch is intriguing, but the Ravens' backfield is far too crowded to make the 22-year-old worthy of a draft pick."

Granted, it's a small sample, but Wilkins has been effective. His career 5.8 YPC trails only that of Raheem Mostert among all backs with at least 100 carries the past two seasons. The 2018 fifth-round pick is underrated but would need two injuries to find his way to fantasy value."

Thompson didn't make much noise as a rookie, registering 171 yards on 46 touches. The 5-foot-8, 200-pound scat back remains an intriguing deep sleeper, considering Kansas City's RB-friendly offense, as well as Thompson's elite efficiency at Utah State. However, the 2019 sixth-round pick would surely need an injury or two to find his way onto the fantasy radar following the team's first-round investment in Edwards-Helaire."

Although durability and age are major questions for the backs above him, it's unlikely that all will miss enough time for Barber to land on the fantasy radar. An early-down plodder with poor efficiency stats (3.6 YPC, 1.7 YAC, 4.7 YPT), the 26-year-old shouldn't be drafted."

Dallas is inexperienced as a receiver (33 career targets), though he averaged an outstanding 9.6 yards per target on those plays.
