1,Michael Thomas,Saints,WR,114.0,1351.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Thomas is fresh off a historic 2019 season in which he set a single-season record for receptions (149) en route to outscoring the next-closest wide receiver by 99 fantasy points. Incredibly, Thomas finished as a top-five fantasy WR nine times during his final 12 games of 2019. During his four NFL campaigns, Thomas has finished no lower than ninth in receptions, yards, catch rate and fantasy points. Thomas' massive 32.5% target share will be hard to repeat, but history suggests he'll still be in the vicinity. Couple that with the return of Drew Brees and the 27-year-old Thomas is primed for another elite performance. He's a top-five overall fantasy asset."
2,DeAndre Hopkins,Cardinals,WR,92.0,1140.0,8.0,4.0,23.0,0.0,"Hopkins was traded to the Cardinals during the offseason and will now operate as Kyler Murray's go-to target. A top-five fantasy WR in four of the past five seasons, Hopkins has averaged 10.5 targets per game during that span, which is a mark he should still be able to approach with Arizona. Murray is far from a finished product, but the Cardinals' offense finished 2019 strong with three-plus touchdowns in eight of their final 11 games -- and that was without one of the game's best receivers. At age 28, Hopkins remains an elite fantasy option and should be selected near the first/second-round turn."
3,Julio Jones,Falcons,WR,89.0,1245.0,7.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,"Jones is now 31 years old but remains an elite fantasy weapon as Matt Ryan's top target in the pass-heavy Atlanta offense. Jones continues to underwhelm in the touchdown department (only 6.2 scores per season since 2014), but he more than makes up for it with both massive targets (10.5 per game over the past two seasons) and receiving yardage (ranked among the top three WRs in each of the past six seasons). Jones' career-low YPT and RAC marks last season are a slight concern for a player now in his 30s, but his heavy usage positions him well for a run at a seventh straight top-seven fantasy campaign. Draft him in the second round."
4,Chris Godwin,Buccaneers,WR,88.0,1191.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Godwin is entering his fourth NFL season and his second as a full-time player. His first season as a full-timer went, in a word, well. Inexplicably a situational player under Dirk Koetter, Godwin finished 2019 ranked as a top-10 WR in snaps, routes, yardage and touchdowns. He finished fourth at the position in catch rate (72%) and RAC (6.6) and was first in first-down rate (50%). Godwin is a candidate for touchdown regression (9 TD, 5.1 OTD) in 2020 and will have a new quarterback in Tom Brady, but the 24-year-old appears to be the real deal. Consider him as a solid WR1."
5,Davante Adams,Packers,WR,90.0,1149.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Adams is back as Aaron Rodgers' unquestioned No. 1 target -- a role that has allowed him to post four consecutive seasons as a top-10 WR in fantasy points per game. Adams handled a career-high 31% target share and was fantasy's No. 2-scoring WR during the 12 weeks in which he was active last season. He finished as a top-five WR in 42% of those outings, which trailed only Michael Thomas. The only concern here is durability as Adams has missed at least one regular-season game due to injury in each of the past three seasons, including four 2019 absences. We'll need to dock him slightly for that, but the 27-year-old's massive usage locks him into the top-end WR1 mix."
6,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,WR,79.0,1120.0,8.0,10.0,65.0,1.0,"Hill heads into his fifth NFL season having never finished lower than fourth among WRs in fantasy points per snap. Last season, the speedster missed four games because of injury and saw a slight dip in usage. Still, he remained a dominant fantasy force when active, posting a top-10 week during one-third of his outings (the league's fifth-highest rate). Hill has scored 36 touchdowns in 59 regular-season games and trails only Travis Kelce in target priority on Andy Reid's high-scoring, pass-heavy Chiefs offense led by Patrick Mahomes. Hill is a solid WR1 with added value in non-PPR formats."
7,Mike Evans,Buccaneers,WR,77.0,1171.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Evans returns as Tampa Bay's top perimeter wide receiver. However, for the first time since his rookie season in 2014, Jameis Winston won't be his primary quarterback. That may not seem ideal after Evans put together four consecutive seasons as a top-17 fantasy WR, but it's very possible that the 26-year-old's efficiency and consistency will actually improve with Tom Brady in town. Evans has ranked near the top of the league in aDOT and YPR throughout his career, but near the basement in both catch rate and RAC. That has led to inconsistent production, including 2019, when 53% of his fantasy point total for the season came during just three games. Even if the big plays are down a bit, Evans will see enough volume and goal-line work (he's never finished lower than ninth in end-zone targets) to reach his third top-10 fantasy campaign."
8,Adam Thielen,Vikings,WR,78.0,1104.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,0.0,"Following the offseason trade of Stefon Diggs to Buffalo, Thielen enters 2020 as the Vikings' clear-cut top target. Thielen missed six games because of injury last season, but was previously extremely reliable, having not missed a single game during his first five seasons. A top-10 fantasy WR in both 2017 and 2018, Thielen sat ninth prior to his Week 7 injury in 2019. Thielen turns 30 this year and Minnesota's run-heavy offense will limit his ceiling, but he's a safe bet for a generous target share and thus, a high fantasy floor. Grab him as your WR2."
9,DJ Moore,Panthers,WR,87.0,1122.0,4.0,7.0,49.0,0.0,"The first wide receiver selected in the 2018 draft, Moore flashed with a 55-788-2 receiving line as a rookie before enjoying a full-on breakout in 2019. Moore finished as a top-10 WR in routes, targets, receptions and receiving yards. Moore's efficiency has been outstanding, as he has dropped just three of 215 career targets, while dominating with the ball in his hands (5.7 RAC). The one drawback has been a lack of scoring (six career TDs, 8.2 OTD), which has limited his ceiling. He managed only two weekly finishes better than 13th and was fantasy's No. 16 WR in 2019. Moore will have new QB Teddy Bridgewater and new coach Matt Rhule this season, but the 23-year-old's heavy usage is unlikely to change, though perhaps he'll see more goal-line work. He's a fringe WR1."
10,Kenny Golladay,Lions,WR,66.0,1114.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"After flashing in 11 games as a third-round rookie in 2017, Golladay has emerged as one of the game's top wide receivers over the past two seasons. Golladay has never finished as a top-15 WR in targets, but has put up a pair of 1,000-yard seasons and paced the NFL with 11 touchdown receptions in 2019. A force deep downfield and near the end zone, Golladay finished in the top 10 in YPT, YPR, aDOT and end-zone targets in 2019. Fantasy's reigning No. 9 WR has emerged as Detroit's top offensive weapon. Considering Matthew Stafford missed half of last season, we may have yet to see the 26-year-old's best work. Golladay is a fringe WR1."
11,JuJu Smith-Schuster,Steelers,WR,80.0,1035.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Smith-Schuster enters 2020 looking to bounce back after a rough 2019 season marred by Ben Roethlisberger's season-ending injury in Week 2, as well as various injuries of his own. After pacing all wide receivers in routes run and finishing top 10 in targets, receptions, receiving yards, end-zone targets and fantasy points during a breakout 2018 campaign, Smith-Schuster was held to a 41-542-3 line in 12 games of ""QB purgatory"" last season. Smith-Schuster is still only 23 years old and a strong bet for a rebound season with Roethlisberger back in action. Consider him to be a WR2 with upside."
12,Allen Robinson II,Bears,WR,85.0,1041.0,6.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,"It took a while following a lost 2017 due to a torn ACL and a transition to Chicago in 2018, but Robinson has finally reestablished himself as one of the game's top receivers. Last season, Robinson paced all wide receivers in snaps while ranking no lower than sixth in routes, targets, receptions and end-zone targets. A lack of post-catch production (2.6 RAC) limited Robinson's yardage, but he still managed his second career top-eight fantasy campaign. Robinson enters his age-27 season without a reliable quarterback, but he is in his prime with a generous target share. Consider him to be a solid WR2."
13,Amari Cooper,Cowboys,WR,75.0,1066.0,7.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,"Cooper re-signed with the Cowboys during the offseason and returns as Dak Prescott's top target. In 2019, Cooper produced his fourth 1,000-yard season in five tries while setting career-best marks in receiving yards, touchdowns and fantasy points in his first full campaign with Dallas. Incredibly, Cooper has yet to finish a season higher than 10th in fantasy points but, in five seasons, he has managed to post four 1,000-yard seasons and three seasons in a row with seven-plus TDs. He also has finished among the top receivers in catch rate and YPT for the past two seasons. Cooper doesn't get the same amount of targets of other top-end WRs, but the 26-year-old's top-end talent -- and Dallas' high-scoring offense --secures his spot as a strong WR2."
14,Robert Woods,Rams,WR,83.0,1051.0,3.0,15.0,101.0,1.0,"Woods doesn't get the headlines, but the 2013 second-round pick has emerged as the high-scoring Rams' No. 1 wide receiver. A top-15 fantasy WR in both of the past two seasons, Woods was targeted nine-plus times in 10 of his 15 games last season. That 67% rate was tied with DJ Moore for fifth best in the league. Woods isn't going to get you many touchdowns, as he's never been above six in a season and saw only two end-zone targets last season. Still, he's a strong bet to push for 130 targets for the third consecutive season. Especially with Brandin Cooks gone, Woods is a fine WR2 target in PPR leagues."
15,Calvin Ridley,Falcons,WR,77.0,1016.0,7.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,"Ridley enters his third NFL season as Atlanta's No. 2 wide receiver behind Julio Jones. The 2018 first-round pick impressed during his first two campaigns, catching 69% of his passes and averaging a healthy 8.0 YPT. Ridley took a step forward last season and actually had one of the highest floors in fantasy, finishing 27th or better during nine of his 13 outings. He sat 14th at the position in fantasy points prior to Week 14's season-ending abdomen injury. Especially with Mohamed Sanu and Austin Hooper gone, Ridley's role as Matt Ryan's No. 2 target is safe. The 25-year-old is a fringe top-20 fantasy receiver."
16,Courtland Sutton,Broncos,WR,73.0,1049.0,7.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,"The Broncos selected Sutton in the second round of the 2018 draft with the hope that he might emerge as their No. 1 wide receiver. He did exactly that in his second season, posting a 72-1,112-6 receiving line en route to a 19th-place fantasy finish. Sutton was terrific after the catch (5.0 RAC), reliable (only two drops on 124 targets), and productive despite some bad touchdown luck (6 TD, 7.2 OTD). Since entering the league, Sutton ranks sixth in the NFL with 23 end-zone targets. The progression of Noah Fant and the arrival of Melvin Gordon, Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler may cost Sutton a few targets, but the 24-year-old will handle enough work to allow for WR2 production."
17,Tyler Lockett,Seahawks,WR,73.0,993.0,7.0,4.0,27.0,0.0,"The 2019 season was Lockett's fifth in the NFL, but his first as Seattle's clear No. 1 wide receiver. It's safe to say he handled himself well, playing through a midseason injury and reaching career-high marks in targets, receptions and yardage. Whereas teammate DK Metcalf paced the NFL in end-zone targets, Lockett finished fourth with 13. Lockett has finished second in catch rate and no lower than 16th in fantasy points both of the past two seasons. His 18 touchdowns are second most at the position during that span. Lockett enters his age-27 season as one of the game's most-efficient receivers and Russell Wilson's top target. He's a solid WR2."
18,Odell Beckham Jr.,Browns,WR,72.0,1010.0,7.0,4.0,24.0,0.0,"Beckham returns for his second season with the Browns following an underwhelming 2019 campaign in which he posted a 74-1,035-4 receiving line and was held to just a single top-10 fantasy week. That stat line would be respectable output for most players, but it's not quite enough for a player who averaged a 96-1,374-12 line during his first three seasons in the league (2014-16). The good news is that Beckham is still in his prime at age 27. He should see some touchdown regression to the mean (4 TD, 5.8 OTD) and the Cleveland offense should be more efficient under new coach Kevin Stefanski. Beckham is best viewed as a mid-to-back-end WR2, but there's obvious upside here."
19,A.J. Brown,Titans,WR,67.0,1040.0,7.0,4.0,27.0,0.0,"Brown is entering his second NFL season after quite the roller-coaster rookie campaign. Following a boom/bust first couple of months, the second-round pick peaked after the Titans' Week 11 bye, posting the second-most fantasy points and four top-10 weeks from that point forward. His five top-10 outings for the season trailed only Michael Thomas for the league high. Brown then crashed back to earth in the playoffs with a mere 64 yards in three games. The inconsistency was frustrating, but Brown appears to be the real deal. His 12.5 YPT and 9.0 RAC both topped the position and he dropped only one of his 84 targets. Brown's TD rate will regress (8 TD, 3.7 OTD), but a boost in volume is probable in Year 2. Consider Ryan Tannehill's top weapon to be a fringe WR2 with upside."
20,Cooper Kupp,Rams,WR,80.0,992.0,6.0,4.0,23.0,0.0,"Kupp is a very tricky evaluation following a bizarre 2019 campaign that can be split into two distinct parts. During Weeks 1-12, Kupp played on 87% of snaps and handled a 25% target share. With Tyler Higbee taking on a larger role during Weeks 13-17, those rates dropped to 63% and 15%, respectively. Kupp still ended up fourth in fantasy points due to the strong start and an unsustainable level of touchdown production (10 TD, 5.6 OTD), but we can't overlook the Rams' scheme change in December. The departure of Brandin Cooks definitely helps, but Kupp is now safest-viewed as a mid-to-back-end WR2."
21,Terry McLaurin,FA,WR,74.0,1070.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Washington drafted McLaurin in the second round of the 2019 draft and it took the Ohio State product just one game to solidify himself as the team's top offensive weapon. McLaurin went on to miss a pair of games due to injury, but ranked 17th in fantasy points during the 14 weeks in which he was active. McLaurin was a bit over his head in the touchdown department (7 TD, 5.8 OTD), but saw a healthy 10 end-zone targets (11th most in the NFL) and his 10.0 YPT was ninth best. The 24-year-old is second-year QB Dwayne Haskins' go-to target and a fringe WR2 in fantasy."
22,Keenan Allen,Chargers,WR,83.0,978.0,5.0,4.0,25.0,0.0,"Allen enters his eighth NFL season in unfamiliar territory. The 2013 third-round pick has been targeted 758 times in his career -- and 751 of them have come from the hand of Philip Rivers. Rivers, who is now with the Colts, has helped Allen to top-13 finishes in targets, receptions, receiving yards and fantasy points in each of the past three seasons. Even with Rivers, Allen is coming off a very boom/bust fantasy campaign in which he was a top-20 WR in half of his outings, but outside the top 30 during the other half. Allen is still in his prime at age 28 and hasn't missed a game since 2016, but he hasn't scored more than six TDs in any season since 2013. The uncertainty of the Chargers' quarterback situation is a red flag, so Allen is best viewed as a WR2."
23,T.Y. Hilton,Colts,WR,71.0,1015.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Hilton enters 2020 looking for a rebound following what was essentially a lost season. As if Andrew Luck's shocking August retirement wasn't enough, injuries limited Hilton to only 10 games and a situational role in the second half of the campaign. Hilton was still effective when healthy, ranking 13th in fantasy points during the six weeks he was active prior to Week 9. Hilton is now 30 years old, but has generally held up well, missing only four games during his first seven seasons. He will now have Philip Rivers throwing him passes. Hilton was a top-27 fantasy WR during each of his first seven seasons and remains very much in the WR2 discussion for 2020."
24,Jarvis Landry,Browns,WR,75.0,976.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Landry was expected to see a big dip in production last season following the Browns' trade for Odell Beckham Jr. Instead, Cleveland's slot man had one of his best NFL seasons and actually out-targeted his teammate 139-132. Landry set a career-high in receiving yardage (1,174) and YPR (14.1) en route to his fifth consecutive top-18 fantasy campaign. Landry has proved to be super reliable, having never missed a game in six seasons and checking in as one of just six players who were targeted in 100% of his 2019 games. New coach Kevin Stefanski could shake things up a bit, but Landry's connection with Baker Mayfield is solid, making him a fine WR3 target."
25,DJ Chark Jr.,Jaguars,WR,73.0,984.0,5.0,2.0,9.0,0.0,"Chark entered 2019 with little fanfare, despite the fact that he was a second-round pick entering his second NFL season and positioned for a significant boost in playing time. It didn't take long for the former LSU star to get noticed. Despite Jacksonville's offensive dysfunction, Chark posted a 73-1,008-8 receiving line. His 12 end-zone targets (over 15 contests) tied for fifth most in the league and only 16 receivers scored more fantasy points. Chark is 23 years old with the size and speed to sustain top-tier production. With Gardner Minshew entering his second season and Jay Gruden perhaps adding a spark to the offense, Chark has the look of a good WR3 with upside."
26,DeVante Parker,Dolphins,WR,70.0,1019.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"It's not often that a player realizes his potential in his fifth NFL season, but that was exactly what happened for Parker last season. After failing to post a single top-50 campaign while totaling nine touchdowns during his first four seasons in Miami, Parker exploded for a 72-1,202-9 receiving line in his first year working with Brian Flores. He ended up as fantasy's No. 11 WR and finished top five in routes run, receiving yards and touchdowns. The 27-year-old has first-round pedigree and had suffered through several injuries, so the leap wasn't a major shock, but we also should proceed with caution in 2020. Miami's top offensive target is safest when targeted as a WR3."
27,DK Metcalf,Seahawks,WR,64.0,924.0,8.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,"Metcalf is entering his second NFL season, following an impressive rookie campaign in which he played on 83% of Seattle's snaps and was responsible for 30% of the team's air yards. Metcalf scored seven touchdowns, but was actually unlucky in that department (8.1 OTD), as the Ole Miss product paced the entire NFL in end-zone targets -- his 19 looks were three more than any other player. Metcalf ended the season as fantasy's No. 33 WR, though his role resulted in only one top-12 fantasy week and seven finishes of 40th or worse. Metcalf is only 22 and good bet for a step forward in his second season. Consider him as a WR3 with the upside for a major breakout."
28,Michael Gallup,Cowboys,WR,64.0,994.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Most would agree that Gallup is the Cowboys' No. 2 wideout behind Amari Cooper, but it's not as clear-cut as you might think. In 13 full games together last season, Gallup played on 44 more snaps and was targeted four more times than his counterpart. Both were top-10 fantasy receivers during those weeks. Gallup looks like the real deal following a breakout second season in which he posted a 66-1,107-6 receiving line and ranked ninth among wide receivers with a 16.8 YPR. The 24-year-old has solidified himself as one of Dak Prescott's go-to targets and, even though his workload could drop slightly with CeeDee Lamb in the mix, he could make up for some of that with more usage near the goal line. He had only three end-zone targets last season. Consider Gallup as a borderline WR3."
29,Marvin Jones Jr.,Lions,WR,62.0,888.0,7.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,"Jones, Kenny Golladay and Danny Amendola played 12 games together last season. The target breakdown in those weeks were as follows: Jones had 86 (20% share), Golladay had 85 (20%), and Amendola saw 78 (18%). When Jones was out during Weeks 15-17, Golladay only edged Amendola 23-20 (24%-21%) in that category. This trio is probably closer than you realize in usage, which may lead to Jones being undervalued in fantasy again. He's now 30, but Jones has scored nine touchdowns in two of the past three seasons and was on pace for nine in 2018 prior to an injury. He finished 14th, 27th and 20th in fantasy points per game during that span."
30,Tyler Boyd,Bengals,WR,78.0,906.0,4.0,4.0,25.0,0.0,"Boyd seemed like a total bust through his first two seasons in the league, but the Bengals' slot man has completely shed that label with a pair of top-18 fantasy campaigns. With A.J. Green sidelined last season, Boyd finished no lower than eighth among receivers in snaps, routes run, targets and receptions. Weak quarterback play led to underwhelming efficiency numbers, but it's very possible that will improve with No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow under center. Boyd isn't going to get you many TDs (12 TD, 7.7 OTD, 7 end zone targets over the past two seasons) and his targets will take a slight hit with the combination of Green's return and rookie Tee Higgins joining the fold. Still, the 25-year-old short-area weapon will rack up plenty of catches. Consider Boyd to be a fine WR3 in PPR formats."
31,A.J. Green,Bengals,WR,68.0,939.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Green is back in Cincinnati after missing the entire 2019 season due to injury. Green will enter his age-32 season having missed at least six regular-season games in three of the past four seasons. Despite the durability woes, he has remained a fantasy force, ranking no worse than 16th in fantasy points per game in each of his eight NFL seasons. When we last saw him healthy, Green was fantasy's No. 7-scoring WR through Week 8 of the 2018 season. Green is obviously a risky investment, especially with a rookie quarterback in Joe Burrow, but the superstar receiver can be considered as a WR3 target with obvious upside."
32,Sterling Shepard,Giants,WR,71.0,786.0,6.0,7.0,52.0,0.0,"Shepard has been a tricky player to figure out so far. The 2016 second-round pick has finished two seasons among the top-eight WRs in routes run, but he's also missed five-plus games in two different seasons and he's yet to finish any season better than No. 30 in fantasy points. Shepard replaced Odell Beckham Jr. as the Giants' No. 1 WR last season -- and he was very busy, handling six-plus targets during all 10 appearances. Only five other players can say the same. Shepard's efficiency was poor, but the volume allowed him the 17th-most fantasy points during those 10 weeks. Shepard will have more competition with a healthier group around him this season, but he's still a legitimate candidate to lead the team in targets. Don't sleep on the 26-year-old when flex hunting."
33,Marquise Brown,Ravens,WR,64.0,860.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Baltimore selected Brown in the first round of the 2019 draft and the speedster was immediately slotted in as the team's top wide receiver by default. Brown's boom/bust rookie campaign began with his best game in Week 1 (4-147-2) followed by mixed results (including a pair of missed games) the rest of the way. Brown ended up as the WR46 on the season, thanks to seven touchdowns on 69 targets. His 10.1% TD rate was second highest at the position and certainly unsustainable. Brown is an obvious bet for a boost in targets in his second season as Lamar Jackson's top perimeter target. The 23-year-old is a breakout candidate and a sharp flex target."
34,Jamison Crowder,Jets,WR,75.0,826.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Crowder has emerged as one of the game's top slot/short-area targets and that skill was on full display in his first season with the Jets. The longtime slot man in Washington posted a healthy 78-833-6 receiving line in New York, leading to a 26th-place finish in fantasy points. Crowder finished near the basement of the position in aDOT (8.1) for the fifth time in as many seasons, which limited big plays (6.8 YPT), but allowed him to soak up receptions (16th most). At 5-foot-8, 185 pounds, Crowder won't get you many touchdowns. Heck, he has only 20 career end zone targets. Still, Sam Darnold's top option will catch enough passes to allow for flex production in PPR leagues."
35,Stefon Diggs,Bills,WR,63.0,947.0,5.0,4.0,26.0,0.0,"Diggs was traded to Buffalo during the offseason and will now operate as the Bills' top target. The 26-year-old posted a trio of top-25 fantasy campaigns during his final three seasons in Minnesota, but now moves to a low-volume, run-first Buffalo offense led by the inefficient and scramble-heavy Josh Allen. That figures to lead to a decrease in production for Diggs, which is a concern considering he was only the WR24 last season -- despite Kirk Cousins' extremely efficient campaign and with Adam Thielen sidelined. Diggs, who has never appeared in all 16 games of a regular season, is likely to be over-drafted and is best viewed as only a WR3."
36,Julian Edelman,Patriots,WR,69.0,818.0,5.0,9.0,54.0,0.0,"Edelman enters his age-34 season fresh off a terrific 2019 campaign in which he finished as a top-five WR in routes, targets, receptions and OTD. He finished the year with a career-best seventh-place finish in fantasy points. Edelman has now finished no worse than 17th in fantasy points per game in each of his past six seasons. Despite all of the success, Edelman's stock is on the decline following Tom Brady's departure. The Patriots' offense is a strong bet for a decrease in passing volume and efficiency and, if that weren't bad enough, Edelman is now 34 and has managed only three career 16-game seasons. Edelman figures to remain prominently targeted, but is now best viewed as a WR3 with limited upside."
37,Diontae Johnson,Steelers,WR,66.0,787.0,5.0,4.0,23.0,0.0,"All things considered, Johnson had a pretty darn impressive rookie season. The 2019 third-round pick was a part-time player for most of the season, but still managed a solid 59-680-5 receiving line on his way to a 39th-place finish in fantasy points. That success came despite his operating in an offense with extremely poor quarterback play. That's unlikely to be an issue again in 2020 with Ben Roethlisberger back from injury. Johnson joins up with JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington and rookie Chase Claypool to form one of the league's top young WR groups. Roethlisberger has supported three fantasy-relevant WRs in the past, so it's certainly possible for multiple receivers to shine in Pittsburgh's pass-heavy offense. Consider Johnson as a flex target with upside."
38,Christian Kirk,Cardinals,WR,63.0,723.0,5.0,15.0,105.0,0.0,"After flashing in a situational role as a rookie in 2018, Kirk saw a boost in usage and was the WR29 during 13 active weeks last season. The former second-round pick handled a very generous 24% target share in his first season with Kyler Murray in Kliff Kingsbury's system. However, he didn't see much work near the goal line (only four end-zone targets) and his 6.8 YPT ranked near the basement of the league. Moving forward, Kirk is a near lock for a big reduction in targets with superstar DeAndre Hopkins now sitting atop the depth chart. Kirk, who has already missed seven games due to injury, will also need to fend off Larry Fitzgerald, Hakeem Butler and Andy Isabella (among others) for targets. The 23-year-old is no more than a borderline flex in deeper leagues."
39,Golden Tate,Giants,WR,65.0,800.0,5.0,4.0,21.0,0.0,"The Giants signed Tate last offseason in order to help replace Odell Beckham Jr. and it worked out fairly well. Tate produced a 49-670-6 receiving line while handling 7.7 targets per game after his return from a four-game suspension to start the season. Tate was the WR28 in fantasy from Week 5 on and sported a very high floor, producing eight top-30 weeks in 11 outings. That 73% rate was fifth best at WR. Tate is entering his age-32 season, but remains elite with the ball in his hands. He has ranked at least 12th in RAC in each of the past seven seasons. Tate won't score often (career-high 5.7 OTD), but he'll be one of Daniel Jones' go-to targets in 2020. Consider the veteran as a PPR flex option."
40,Preston Williams,Dolphins,WR,63.0,837.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Williams went undrafted last season because of off-the-field concerns, but it appears that Miami has found itself a gem. The Colorado State product was a factor right out of the gate, handling a team-high 7.4 targets per game (21% share) prior to tearing his ACL in Week 9. Williams struggled with drops (4) and off-target throws (his 25% rate was 13th highest), but was still a respectable WR37 in fantasy prior to the injury. The 23-year-old was out-targeting DeVante Parker as a rookie and it's possible he overtakes the veteran again this season. Consider Williams for your flex spot."
41,Brandin Cooks,Texans,WR,58.0,829.0,5.0,4.0,24.0,0.0,"Cooks was traded to the Texans during the offseason and will compete for targets with Will Fuller V, Randall Cobb and Kenny Stills. At 26, Cooks is still in his prime, but has already been traded three times. Despite the constant movement, he has finished four of the past five seasons as a top-15 fantasy WR. Primarily a vertical threat, Cooks ranked no lower than ninth in YPT in the three seasons prior to an injury-plagued 2019 campaign with the Rams. Concussions are an ongoing concern for Cooks, but, if healthy, he's in good shape as one of Deshaun Watson's top targets. He should be on your flex radar, though there's certainly WR2 upside to be found here."
42,Henry Ruggs III,Raiders,WR,59.0,788.0,5.0,4.0,24.0,0.0,"The Raiders have a history of targeting speed at wide receivers, so it was no surprise when they selected Ruggs (4.27 40-yard dash) with the 12th pick of April's draft. The 5-foot-11, 188-pound playmaker has great hands, ball skills and is exceptional after the catch. The Alabama product was limited to 55 targets in 2019, but his 13.6 YPT and 10.5 RAC were both top four in this year's rookie class. Ruggs figures to operate as a perimeter lid-lifter and returner in the pros, which would be good news in the explosive-play department, but it could cap his target upside. That said, the Raiders have such a severe need at wideout that Ruggs is very likely to step right into an every-down role. The Raiders' new No. 1 wide receiver is a borderline flex in 2020 leagues."
43,Robby Anderson,Panthers,WR,57.0,837.0,5.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,"Following four seasons with the Jets, Anderson signed with Carolina during the offseason. Anderson went undrafted in 2016, but went on to appear in 62 of 64 games with New York, hauling in 206 passes for 3,034 yards and 20 touchdowns. Anderson was limited to one strong fantasy campaign (18th in 2017) and finished 39th and 40th in the past two seasons. In Anderson's defense, a position-high 33% of balls thrown his direction were 'off target' last season. In Carolina, the 26-year-old vertical threat will work alongside DJ Moore and Curtis Samuel in Matt Rhule's new-look offense led by QB Teddy Bridgewater. Consistency is unlikely with Christian McCaffrey as the focal point of the Panthers' offense, so Anderson is safest as a borderline flex play in deeper leagues."
44,Deebo Samuel,49ers,WR,54.0,717.0,4.0,15.0,130.0,1.0,"It took Samuel a couple of months to get rolling, but the 2019 second-round pick worked his way to a prominent offensive role right around the midpoint of his rookie season. From Weeks 10-17, the Clemson product played on 82% of the 49ers' snaps. Powered by 697 yards and four touchdowns, he was fantasy's No. 9 scoring WR. He kept it up in the playoffs with 229 yards on 16 touches. Samuel was primarily used near the line of scrimmage, posting one of the position's lowest aDOTs (7.7), but also the fifth-best catch rate (71%), the seventh-best YPT (10.0) and the second-best RAC (8.1). A weapon as both a receiver and rusher, Samuel shouldn't struggle for touches in Kyle Shanahan's offense once he returns from a leg injury. He's a solid WR3 option with upside once healthy, so take him with a late-round pick."
45,Emmanuel Sanders,Saints,WR,56.0,746.0,6.0,2.0,13.0,0.0,"Sanders is now 33, but the veteran receiver is well-situated for another season of fantasy relevance after signing with the high-scoring Saints. Sanders is no longer the target hog he was during his prime, but he has nonetheless managed a pair of top-30 fantasy campaigns over the past two seasons. Sanders has seen top-10 finishes in catch rate in both of the past two seasons and figures to work as one of Drew Brees' top targets in the short-to-intermediate area behind Michael Thomas. Sanders is unlikely to be a major asset near the goal line, as he has cleared six touchdowns in a season just once in his career. Nevertheless, he'll see enough volume to warrant weekly flex consideration."
46,Darius Slayton,Giants,WR,55.0,775.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"In a performance that was eerily similar (albeit not quite as dominant) to the one of the man he helped replace (Odell Beckham Jr.), Slayton missed the first two games of his rookie season before bursting onto the fantasy scene with eight touchdowns in 14 games. Slayton was on the field for 77% of the Giants' pass plays and was WR27 in fantasy points from Week 3 on. Slayton's touchdown rate is far from sustainable (3.5 OTD), but the 2019 fifth-round pick will enter his second season as New York's primary vertical threat. The New York offense has a lot of mouths to feed, but there's certainly a window for Slayton to become the team's No. 1 wideout. Slayton is safest as a flex in deeper leagues."
47,Will Fuller V,Texans,WR,56.0,781.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The Texans traded away DeAndre Hopkins during the offseason, which should vault 2016 first-round pick Fuller to a full-on fantasy breakout. The problem, of course, is that Fuller is entering his fifth NFL season having already missed 34% of his team's games because of injury. That number includes five games last season. The good news is that, when healthy, Fuller has been heavily targeted and productive. In nine full games last season, he handled 7.7 targets per game (a 25% share) and trailed Hopkins by only nine total targets. He was fantasy's No. 13 WR in those weeks. It's hard to expect a full season from the oft-injured receiver, but Fuller undoubtedly still has massive upside. The 26-year-old is best viewed as a flex."
48,John Brown,Bills,WR,55.0,791.0,4.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,"Brown's first season with the Bills was a giant success, as the vertical threat set career-best marks in targets (116), receptions (72) and receiving yards (1,060). Brown handled a generous 26% target share during 15 regular-season games and finished 20th at wide receiver in fantasy points. Despite the strong output, Brown's fantasy stock has taken a hit due to Buffalo's trade for Stefon Diggs. With an expectation for reduced target share, a vertical role that limits consistency and receptions, and a run-heavy scheme, it's hard to view Brown as a safe weekly starter. The 30-year-old is a fringe flex option."
49,Curtis Samuel,Panthers,WR,54.0,665.0,5.0,14.0,95.0,1.0,"Samuel's career advanced another step last season as the 2017 second-round pick appeared in 16 games for the first time in his career and posted career-high totals in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. His efficiency wasn't good (51% catch rate, 5.9 YPT), although some of that can be blamed on a 28% off-target rate (eighth highest in the NFL). Samuel did finish as 2019's No. 26 fantasy WR, thanks in part to his also being a factor as a rusher (19-130-1 on the ground). He is sure to sustain a significant role in Matt Rhule's new-look offense, but Carolina's signing of Robby Anderson is sure to cost Samuel targets. As such, he's only a flex option in deeper leagues."
50,Mike Williams,Chargers,WR,48.0,824.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Slowly but surely, Williams' pro career continues to progress. The 2017 first-round pick barely played as a rookie, posting a 43-664-10 receiving line in a situational role in 2018. He followed that up with a 49-1,001-2 line as a full-time player in 2019. Last season, Williams paced the NFL in aDOT (17.3) and YPR (20.4) and ranked fourth in YPT (11.0), but dealt with the worst luck in the league in the touchdown department. Williams posted a 6.9 OTD thanks to 11 end-zone targets (tied for eighth most), but scored only twice. The 25-year-old is a strong bet for more touchdowns, but the departure of Philip Rivers hurts his stock. Williams is a more appealing flex choice in non-PPR leagues."
51,Breshad Perriman,Jets,WR,48.0,775.0,5.0,2.0,11.0,0.0,"Perriman is in and Robby Anderson is out as the top perimeter target in the Jets' offense. A 2015 first-round pick, Perriman struggled in Baltimore before getting his career back on track in Cleveland and Tampa Bay over the past two seasons. Perriman was a situational target in Tampa Bay for most of 2019, but with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin injured, he produced a 25-506-5 receiving line and was a WR3 in fantasy during Weeks 13-17. Perriman's NFL resume includes more struggles than success, which makes him a risky investment, but he's well-positioned for an every-down role with New York. That's enough to make him a fine late-round flier, with a shot at flex numbers."
52,Mecole Hardman,Chiefs,WR,50.0,688.0,5.0,5.0,26.0,0.0,"Hardman was limited to 44% of the Chiefs' offensive snaps and a grand total of 41 targets during his rookie season. The 2019 second-round pick provided his fair share of explosive plays with a 26-538-6 receiving line, which provides plenty of optimism for the 23-year-old's future in Kansas City's elite offense. Hardman's short-term outlook is a bit cloudy with both Sammy Watkins and Demarcus Robinson returning, but Hardman is just one depth-chart adjustment or injury away from working as one of Patrick Mahomes' primary targets. You may not be able to start him much early on, but Hardman is an excellent upside target in the mid-to-late rounds."
53,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,WR,56.0,711.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Denver selected Jeudy with the 15th pick of April's draft. The Alabama product sports a 6-foot-1, 193-pound frame and is extremely versatile, having shown the ability to produce on all levels, as well as in the slot (69% in 2019) and on the perimeter. Jeudy is fast (4.45 40-yard dash), agile and a quality route-runner. Jeudy slots in behind Courtland Sutton but has little competition for snaps otherwise and should be an every-down player out of the gate. Jeudy has WR1 upside down the road but should be viewed as a shaky flex option for 2020 in a run-heavy Broncos offense and with Drew Lock still an unknown."
54,N'Keal Harry,Patriots,WR,53.0,660.0,4.0,9.0,52.0,0.0,"The Patriots drafted Harry in the first round of the 2019 draft, but an injury limited the Arizona State product to a 12-105-2 receiving line on only 23 targets in just seven regular-season games. Though he operated in a situational role, Harry actually paced the Patriots in targets during their final two games (including the wild-card loss to Tennessee). Harry is obviously a strong candidate for a great leap forward in his second season, especially with little competition for targets behind Julian Edelman. The big question mark here is quarterback play, as Cam Newton's health and Jarrett Stidham's ability are major unknowns. Harry is worth a bench spot because of his upside and pedigree, but he can't be considered a viable flex at the start of 2020."
55,Justin Jefferson,Vikings,WR,56.0,689.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Minnesota used the 22nd pick of April's draft to select Jefferson ' the de facto replacement for Stefon Diggs. Jefferson is 6-foot-1, 202 pounds with outstanding ball skills and contested-catch ability. The former LSU Tiger also has decent wheels (4.43 40), though he doesn't stand out in terms of perimeter separation or against press, which helps explain why he aligned in the slot 90% of the time in 2019. With only Adam Thielen ahead of him on the depth chart, Jefferson won't be short of playing time as a rookie, which isn't new for the player who paced the FBS with 111 receptions in 2019. Jefferson's 83% catch rate and 18 touchdowns were best in this year's rookie class. Jefferson's short-term upside will be limited by Minnesota's run-heavy offense, but he's still worth a late-round pick."
56,CeeDee Lamb,Cowboys,WR,51.0,677.0,5.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,"Dallas selected Lamb with the 17th pick of April's draft. The Oklahoma product is fresh off a dominant 2019 campaign, in which he averaged 14.3 yards per target, 4.0 yards per route run and 11.1 yards after the catch ' all of which were best in this year's rookie class. Lamb is lean (198 pounds) but tall (6-foot-2) with solid speed (4.50 40-yard dash), as well as terrific separation and post-catch ability. Lamb is in and Randall Cobb out behind Amari Cooper and Michael Gallup, and so, while being third in line will limit Lamb's upside, note that all three 2019 Cowboys receivers were top 31 in fantasy points during 13 full weeks together. Add in Mike McCarthy's history of heavy reliance on three-wide sets and Lamb could flirt with flex value. He is a worth a late-round pick."
57,Jalen Reagor,Eagles,WR,51.0,641.0,5.0,2.0,13.0,0.0,"The Eagles selected Reagor with the 21st pick of April's draft. The TCU product is a bit tricky to decipher, as he put together a strong 72-1061-9 receiving line in 2018 prior to seeing his production and efficiency plummet in 2019. Reagor was held to 6.6 YPT and a 47% catch rate last season, but a prospect-low 60% of his targets were charted as catchable (55 of 92). Quarterback play was obviously an issue, though Reagor did have problems of his own, with nine drops and six fumbles. Reagor (5-foot-11, 206 pounds) has 4.47 speed and can contribute as a receiver, returner and ball carrier. The Eagles obviously believe they're getting the 2018 version of Reagor, and he'll have a shot to play a ton early on if Alshon Jeffery isn't a factor. Take him with a late pick."
58,Hunter Renfrow,Raiders,WR,56.0,647.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The Raiders were busy addressing their shaky wide receiver room during April's draft, but Renfrow stills appears well-positioned as the team's primary slot receiver. In 13 games during his rookie campaign, the 2019 fifth-round pick handled a healthy 18% target share (5.5 per game) and was the WR39 in fantasy. The additions of Henry Ruggs III, Bryan Edwards, Lynn Bowden and perhaps Nelson Agholor figure to cost Renfrow some work, but it's not crazy to think he could pace Las Vegas in targets. Consider spending a late-round pick on Renfrow in PPR leagues."
59,DeSean Jackson,Eagles,WR,47.0,742.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The Eagles reacquired Jackson last offseason in the hope that he would add a vertical element to their offense. Things looked good early on, with Jackson exploding for an 8-154-2 receiving line in Week 1, but it was all downhill from there. Jackson managed only one target the rest of the season due to injury. The Eagles will give it another go with Jackson in 2020, but he's now 33 and hasn't played a full season since 2013. Jackson can still be a weekly starter in fantasy, so he's worth a late-round pick, but make sure you have a backup plan."
60,Larry Fitzgerald,Cardinals,WR,56.0,601.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Fitzgerald is back for his 17th NFL season. Arizona's primary slot receiver put together another solid season in 2019, ranking 17th in the league in receptions (75), while not dropping a single one of his 108 targets. No longer a downfield threat, Fitzgerald has ranked in the 17th percentile or lower in YPR in each of the past five seasons and hasn't cleared six touchdowns since 2015. Fitzgerald's role limited him to just one weekly finish better than 19th last season (ninth in Week 1). Fitzgerald is entering his age-37 season and his targets will take another hit with DeAndre Hopkins now in the fold. Fitzgerald has a very low ceiling and is only an option in very deep PPR leagues."
61,Anthony Miller,Bears,WR,54.0,677.0,3.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,"A 2018 second-round pick, Miller is entering the all-important third NFL season having yet to solidify himself as a full-time player. Chicago's slot man flashed with a 33-423-7 receiving line as a rookie, but his usage was all over the place during a 2019 campaign that saw him finish as the WR56 in fantasy. Of Miller's 85 targets, 40 (47%) came in just three games. There's still hope for the 25-year-old, as Chicago's severe lack of WR depth puts him in line for a sizable role in 2020. The team's shaky quarterback situation is a problem, but Miller is still a nice late-round sleeper in PPR leagues."
62,Cole Beasley,Bills,WR,59.0,637.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Beasley wanted a bigger piece of the pie and he certainly got it in his first season in Buffalo. The undersized slot man set career highs in targets (104) and touchdowns (6) en route to a WR34 finish in fantasy. Despite a generous 19% target share, Beasley's low ceiling remained a problem, as he managed only three weekly finishes better than 26th. Strictly a short-area target, Beasley has finished every season of his career in the 11th percentile or lower in aDOT, and his 2.9 OTD suggests he's headed for regression in the touchdown department. Buffalo's trade for Stefon Diggs will cost Beasley plenty of targets, so the 31-year-old can only be viewed as a low-ceiling bench option in deep PPR leagues."
63,Dede Westbrook,Jaguars,WR,56.0,592.0,3.0,3.0,21.0,0.0,"Westbrook is entering his fourth NFL season following back-to-back years with incredibly similar output. Jacksonville's slot man posted a 66-717-5 receiving line on 102 targets and 502 routes in 2018 and a 66-660-3 line on 104 targets and 504 routes last season. Westbrook's 6.7 aDOT was second lowest among 80 qualified wide receivers last season, which limited him to an ugly 6.3 YPT. Westbrook has yet to produce a top-30 fantasy campaign and isn't much of a threat downfield or near the goal line. In short, the 26-year-old lacks upside and will lose work to rookie Laviska Shenault Jr. Consider him as a bench option in PPR leagues."
64,Danny Amendola,Lions,WR,56.0,625.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Amendola re-upped with the Lions and returns as Matthew Stafford's primary slot target. Though Amendola's 78 targets barely trailed Marvin Jones (86) and Kenny Golladay (85) during the 12 games the trio played together last season, he wasn't anywhere near the fantasy contributor that his counterparts proved to be. The culprits were a heavy dosage of short-area targets (8.6 aDOT, 6.9 YPT) and the usual lack of touchdowns (1 TD, 2 end-zone targets). Amendola has been around since 2008, but has never cleared four touchdowns in a single season. The 34-year-old also hasn't finished any season better than WR43 in fantasy since 2010. He's well off the fantasy radar."
65,Russell Gage,Falcons,WR,52.0,563.0,4.0,4.0,18.0,0.0,"Gage is an intriguing deep sleeper this season after the Falcons failed to address the WR position during free agency and the draft. The 2018 sixth-round pick was promoted to slot duties in Atlanta's pass-heavy offense last season following the trade of Mohamed Sanu. Counting only weeks in which Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley also played, Gage handled a 16% target share and was the WR40 for fantasy. Especially with Austin Hooper no longer in the fold, Gage is well-positioned for a similar role in his third NFL season. Consider him late in deep PPR leagues."
66,Sammy Watkins,Chiefs,WR,46.0,646.0,4.0,3.0,22.0,0.0,"Watkins enters his seventh NFL season having yet to finish a season better than WR20 in fantasy points and having failed to manage a top-40 fantasy campaign since 2015. Injuries (17 missed games over the past four seasons) and a lack of touchdowns (three or fewer scores in three of the past four seasons) have been a large part of what has held him back, but Watkins also hasn't solidified himself as a consistent, go-to target. Watkins opened 2019 with a dominant 9-198-3 receiving line in Week 1, but didn't score or clear 13 fantasy points in any game the rest of the way. The 26-year-old obviously has some appeal in the Chiefs' high-scoring offense, but there's a good chance he loses work to second-year Mecole Hardman. Watkins is worth no more than a late-round flier."
67,Steven Sims Jr.,FA,WR,50.0,558.0,3.0,7.0,43.0,0.0,No outlook available.
68,Parris Campbell,Colts,WR,44.0,548.0,4.0,13.0,72.0,0.0,"A 2019 second-round pick, Campbell appeared to be well-positioned for a huge rookie season in the WR-needy Indianapolis offense. Instead, the speedy short-area weapon was limited by injury to a mere 22 touches in seven games. Campbell will be an intriguing post-hype sleeper in his second season, especially with Philip Rivers now under center. The Colts' depth chart remains wide open behind 30-year-old T.Y. Hilton, with Campbell and rookie Michael Pittman Jr. likely to handle big roles. Campbell is super-fast (a 4.31 40-yard dash) and quick (a 4.03 short shuttle) with the ability to contribute from the slot, as a rusher and as a returner. He's well worth grabbing for your bench."
69,Randall Cobb,Texans,WR,46.0,585.0,3.0,4.0,20.0,0.0,"Cobb signed with the Texans during the offseason following eight seasons in Green Bay and one in Dallas. Houston will look to Cobb and fellow acquisition Brandin Cooks to help replace DeAndre Hopkins, who was traded to Arizona. A fantasy standout during his early years, Cobb has missed at least one game in each of the past four seasons, failing to do better than four touchdowns during any of those campaigns. Cobb continues to dominate with the ball in his hands, as he's never finished lower than 17th in RAC, but his role has prevented him from posting a single top-30 fantasy season since 2014. Operating in a crowded WR picture that also includes Cooks, Will Fuller and Kenny Stills, Cobb is best viewed as a bench option in deep PPR leagues."
70,Corey Davis,Titans,WR,44.0,571.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Davis is entering his fourth NFL season having yet to emerge as a go-to target after being drafted with the fifth overall pick of the 2017 draft. Davis did take a bit of a leap with a 65-891-4 receiving line in 2018, but plummeted to 43-601-2 last season as then-rookie A.J. Brown took over as the Titans' No. 1 receiver. Despite standing 6-foot-3, Davis has scored a grand total of six touchdowns in three seasons. The 25-year-old could still make a leap forward, but he's a long shot for consistent fantasy value in Tennessee's run-heavy scheme."
71,Denzel Mims,Jets,WR,45.0,574.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The Jets selected Mims in the second round of April's draft. Mims is a long (6-foot-3, 207 pounds), perimeter receiver who helped himself with strong showings at the Senior Bowl and combine. The Baylor product is a physical and explosive vertical presence with long arms and an exceptional catch radius. He ran a 4.38 40-yard dash and class-best 6.66 three cone in Indianapolis. Separation ability and drops (20 the past three seasons) are the primary concern areas. Jamison Crowder is locked in as the Jets' slot receiver, but the team's perimeter situation is wide-open, with Mims' only legitimate competition newcomer Breshad Perriman. Mims is a fine roster stash, but it figures to take some time for him to join the weekly flex discussion."
72,Allen Lazard,Packers,WR,43.0,572.0,4.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,"The Packers did surprisingly little to address a shaky WR situation behind Davante Adams during the offseason, which positions Lazard very well for a sizable 2020 role. The undrafted 2018 free agent first saw extended action in Week 6 last season and went on to average 4.8 targets the rest of the way. That allowed a 35-477-3 receiving line and the 51st-most fantasy points among receivers. Green Bay is expected to lean more on the run this season, so Lazard will need to fend off the likes of Devin Funchess, Jake Kumerow and Marquez Valdes-Scantling for snaps. There's not much to like here past the probable generous snap count, so consider Lazard only in very deep leagues."
73,Chris Conley,Jaguars,WR,41.0,595.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No outlook available.
74,Brandon Aiyuk,49ers,WR,40.0,532.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"San Francisco selected Aiyuk with the 25th pick of April's draft. Aiyuk comes in at 6-foot, 205 pounds with 4.50 40-yard speed, as well as terrific explosiveness and route-running ability. The Arizona State product's best asset is his post-catch production (10.5 RAC in 2019), which helped him to plenty of big plays at ASU. Aiyuk doesn't have a ton of competition for early-career snaps, but he should be considered a long shot for weekly fantasy value in a super-run-heavy 49ers' offense that will lean heavily on George Kittle and Deebo Samuel. He's worth only a late-round pick."
75,Mohamed Sanu Sr.,Patriots,WR,47.0,495.0,3.0,5.0,26.0,0.0,"Sanu is back with the Patriots after being acquired by the team prior to the 2019 trade deadline. Sanu's New England career certainly got off to a slow start. The veteran receiver posted a 10-81-1 receiving line in his second game with the team, but went on to total 15 catches for 114 yards during his final seven games. Sanu is entering his age-30 season and hasn't cleared five touchdowns in a season in his career. Plus, Tom Brady is no longer in the picture. Sanu is a fine late flier in deep PPR leagues, but there's minimal upside."
76,Michael Pittman Jr.,Colts,WR,39.0,531.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The Colts selected Pittman with the 34th pick of April's draft. The USC product has a huge frame (6-foot-4, 223 pounds), as well as outstanding hands and ball skills to go along with very good route running and contested-catch ability. He doesn't stand out in terms of speed (4.52 40) or post-catch ability but has drawn Courtland Sutton and Alshon Jeffery comps as a player who will dominate as a perimeter possession receiver and goal-line weapon. Headed to a wide receiver-needy Colts team, Pittman figures to see the field in a hurry in the pros. Parris Campbell and Zach Pascal will be his primary competition for snaps behind T.Y. Hilton, so Pittman could emerge as one of Philip Rivers' top three targets in a hurry. Consider him a fine late-round flier."

79,Josh Reynolds,Rams,WR,35.0,483.0,3.0,8.0,46.0,0.0,"After spending three seasons as a reserve, Reynolds finally has a shot at a solidified offensive role following the Rams' trade of Brandin Cooks to Houston. Despite the promotion, expectations should be tempered. For starters, Reynolds' efficiency hasn't been great on his 120 career targets (51% catch rate, 6.9 YPT). Additionally, Sean McVay adjusted his scheme in the second half of last season, pivoting from using ""11"" personnel a league-high 90% of the time when passing during Weeks 1-13 to just 75% of the time (15th highest in the NFL) during the final month. That change led to reduced roles for the team's secondary receivers and a larger role for TE Tyler Higbee. A potential boost in targets puts Reynolds on the late-round flier radar, but he'll need to fend off rookie Van Jefferson -- and this offense is no longer likely to support three fantasy-relevant wideouts."
80,Devin Funchess,Packers,WR,35.0,474.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Funchess signed with Green Bay during the offseason after missing all but 36 snaps in 2019 because of a collarbone injury. The 2015 second-round pick first stepped into a full-time role in 2017 and exploded for a 63-840-8 line and a 22nd-place fantasy campaign. The towering 6-foot-4, 225-pound receiver played a similar role early in 2018, but inefficient play and a change in scheme eventually led to a demotion. Funchess is positioned well for a rebound, as the Packers' depth chart is wide open behind Davante Adams. Funchess also will enjoy a quarterback upgrade to Aaron Rodgers and figures to be busy near the goal line (32 career end-zone targets). The 26-year-old is a decent flier in deeper leagues."
81,James Washington,Steelers,WR,35.0,533.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"A popular 2019 breakout candidate, Washington entered his second NFL campaign positioned for a big workload following the departure of Antonio Brown. Instead, Ben Roethlisberger went down for the season in Week 2 and the 2018 second-round pick had to deal with a league-high 33% of balls thrown his way registering as off-target. Washington still ended up with a decent 44-735-3 receiving line while posting the position's fourth-highest aDOT (15.9), but he simply wasn't much of a fantasy factor. Now 24, Washington joins JuJu Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson and rookie Chase Claypool to form a formidable young foursome for a now-healthy Ben Roethlisberger. Washington's role makes him more valuable in non-PPR, but the vertical threat is a post-hype breakout candidate and will deliver the occasional splash play. Consider him for your bench in deep leagues."
82,Antonio Gandy-Golden,FA,WR,35.0,500.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Washington drafted Gandy-Golden with a fourth-round pick during April's draft. The Liberty product is an intriguing height/weight/speed prospect at 6-foot-4, 223 pounds. He has a big catch radius and is terrific with the ball in his hands, though short-area quickness is a concern. Gandy-Golden showed well in most efficiency stats last season despite only 62% (87 of 140) of his targets registering as catchable (second lowest in this class). He projects as a perimeter vertical receiver (14.1 aDOT last season) in the pros and will immediately compete with the likes of Kelvin Harmon and Cody Latimer opposite Terry McLaurin. Gandy-Golden is a long shot for 2020 fantasy value."
83,Tyrell Williams,Raiders,WR,32.0,477.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Williams' first season with the Raiders had its ups and downs. Forced atop the depth chart by Antonio Brown's shenanigans, Williams opened the season with a touchdown in each of the first five games. However, he scored just one more touchdown while averaging 4.5 targets per game the rest of the season. Williams has now finished between WR45 and WR50 in fantasy points in each of the past three seasons and his 10.6% drop rate was worst at the position in 2019. Almost exclusively a deep threat, Williams will continue to struggle for targets with super-conservative Derek Carr under center and rookies Henry Ruggs III, Bryan Edwards and Lynn Bowden added to the fold. At best, Williams should be stashed on fantasy benches."
84,Alshon Jeffery,Eagles,WR,33.0,417.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Jeffery continues to be one of the more frustrating players in fantasy. On one hand, he's underrated. Jeffery was WR21 in his first season with the Eagles in 2017, WR22 on a per-game basis in 13 games in 2018 and WR11 during eight full games in 2019. On the other hand, he has now missed at least three games during four of the past five regular seasons. Jeffery is now 30 years old, but figures to continue to play a prominent role in the Eagles offense. He can't be counted on for a full season (and may well begin the season on the PUP list), but figures to be a flex option when active. He's only worth a late flier at the moment."
85,Chase Claypool,Steelers,WR,31.0,415.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Pittsburgh drafted Claypool in the second round of April's draft. Claypool is a huge (6-foot-4, 238 pounds) and physical receiver with terrific speed (4.42 40-yard dash) and playmaking ability. The Notre Dame product's NFL role has yet to be determined, as he has experience as a perimeter receiver, but some teams also preferred him at tight end. Regardless, Claypool is unlikely to find his way to short-term fantasy value with JuJu Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson and James Washington ahead of him on the depth chart. He doesn't need to be drafted in 2020 leagues."
86,Tee Higgins,Bengals,WR,32.0,426.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The Bengals selected Higgins with the 33rd pick of April's draft. Higgins checks in at 6-foot-4, 216 pounds and has drawn comparisons to new teammate A.J. Green due to his frame, catch radius and terrific ball skills. The Clemson product profiles as a perimeter receiver (19% slot last season) who will do a lot of his damage downfield (14.6 aDOT) and near the goal line. Higgins averaged 3.8 yards per route run in 2019, which was second-best in this year's rookie class. Higgins has the talent to eventually emerge as a fantasy force (and perhaps even Joe Burrow's top target), but it might take some time for him to see the field, with Green, Tyler Boyd and John Ross also on the 2020 depth chart. He's barely worth a late-round pick in 2020 leagues."

89,KJ Hamler,Broncos,WR,32.0,389.0,2.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,"Denver nabbed Hamler with the 46th pick of April's draft. The Penn State product is an explosive but extremely undersized (5-foot-9, 178 pounds) receiver who has drawn Tavon Austin comps due to his small frame, terrific speed and versatility. Hamler's hands are an issue (nine drops last season), and his size will surely limit his scoring opportunities and perhaps his fantasy upside. He figures to be busy as a slot weapon (89% slot last season), returner (81 combined kick and punt returns at PSU) and rusher (13 carries in 2019) in Denver. He'll be the favorite for a substantial Week 1 role, but the presences of Courtland Sutton, Jerry Jeudy, Noah Fant, Melvin Gordon and Phillip Lindsay leave Hamler unlikely to find his way to consistent rookie-season fantasy value. He's worth a late pick only in deep PPR leagues."

91,Trent Taylor,49ers,WR,31.0,346.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The 49ers were expecting big things from Taylor last season, but a foot injury cost him the entire 2019 campaign. The 26-year-old slot man will get another opportunity for a breakout this season, though he'll have more competition for targets with the likes of Deebo Samuel, Brandon Aiyuk, Kendrick Bourne and Jalen Hurd all in the mix, not to mention target-hog George Kittle at tight end. At 5-foot-8, 179 pounds, Taylor won't be much of a factor near the goal line (three TDs and five end-zone targets in 29 career games) or down the field (a career 6.6 aDOT). He's only worth a look in deep PPR leagues due to the 49ers' run-heavy offense."
92,Kenny Stills,Texans,WR,27.0,380.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Stills will be back with the Texans after posting a 40-561-4 receiving line during his first season with the club. Stills missed three games and was limited to 4.2 targets per game, but caught 73% of his targets (third best) and averaged 10.2 YPT (fifth best). Stills ended up as WR60 in fantasy points and, believe it or not, has now finished no better than 46th in four of the past five seasons. DeAndre Hopkins is gone, but Stills will need to beat out Will Fuller, Brandin Cooks and Randall Cobb for targets. Stills is a long shot for consistent fantasy value, barring multiple injuries to his teammates."
93,Tyler Johnson,Buccaneers,WR,29.0,359.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The Buccaneers selected Johnson in the fifth round of April's draft. The former Minnesota star is a good route runner, and his outstanding strength and ball skills have made him a force in contested situations. The former Gopher checks in with decent size at 6-foot-1, 206 pounds, but underwhelming speed and separation ability probably mean he'll be ticketed for slot duties in the pros (he aligned in the slot 81% of the time in 2019). Johnson's 3.7 YPRR last season was third best in this class. Despite the fall to Round 5, Johnson will have a legitimate shot to compete for No. 3 duties behind Chris Godwin and Mike Evans in the new-look Buccaneers' offense. That's enough to keep him on your radar in deeper leagues."
94,Laviska Shenault Jr.,Jaguars,WR,29.0,339.0,2.0,7.0,40.0,0.0,"The Jaguars selected Shenault with the 42nd pick of April's draft. Shenault is a bit of a boom/bust prospect, as he sports good size (6-foot-1, 227 pounds) and playmaking ability but has durability and route-running concerns. The Colorado product is an explosive, physical receiver with good hands and post-catch ability. Perhaps more of an 'offensive weapon' than a wide receiver, he's versatile enough to play outside, in the slot (36% in 2019) or in the backfield (23 carries last season). Expect him to be busy in a variety of roles as a rookie, though the Jaguars' wide receiver trio (DJ Chark, Dede Westbrook and Chris Conley) is likely to limit his 2020 fantasy contributions. Shenault is a fine late-round flier."

96,John Ross III,Bengals,WR,22.0,316.0,2.0,4.0,22.0,0.0,"Ross has certainly flashed since setting the NFL combine 40-yard dash record and being drafted ninth overall in 2017, but injuries continue to derail his career. Ross missed 13 games as a rookie, three contests in 2018 and eight more last season. Ross appeared to be on the verge of a breakout in 2019, opening the season with a pair of top-10 fantasy weeks, but he was held to just one top-50 outing in his final six games. Ross is only 24, so it's too early to throw in the towel, but he may have trouble finding consistent targets with A.J. Green, Tyler Boyd, Tee Higgins and Joe Mixon dominating Cincinnati's offensive touches. Ross has value only as a late flier in non-PPR leagues."
97,Miles Boykin,Ravens,WR,21.0,305.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The WR-needy Ravens selected Boykin in the third round of the 2019 draft, but the Notre Dame product wasn't asked to do much during his rookie campaign. The 6-foot-4, 220-pound perimeter weapon was targeted only 22 times on 404 snaps in 16 games. Boykin is an obvious candidate for a leap forward in his second season. He's an excellent athlete, having posted terrific marks in the 40-yard dash (4.42), three-cone drill (6.77), short shuttle (4.07) and broad jump (140 inches) at the 2019 combine. The Ravens' run-heavy offense is a concern, but there are also plenty of touchdowns to go around. An every-down role could get Boykin into the flex discussion in non-PPR leagues, but he'll first need to beat out rookie Devin Duvernay."

104,Devin Duvernay,Ravens,WR,19.0,215.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,0.0,"Baltimore selected Duvernay with a third-round pick during April's draft. Duvernay (5-foot-10, 200 pounds) is a physical and fast (4.39 40, 4.20 short shuttle) slot receiver with good hands. Granted, he was a short-area target (98% slot, 7.5 aDOT), but Duvernay caught 95% (or 106) of 112 catchable targets at Texas last season, which was easily best in this class. He ranked third in the FBS with 106 receptions. Duvernay has the look of a high-volume short-area target in the pros who can also help as a ball carrier and kick returner. He'll spend his rookie campaign competing with Marquise Brown, Miles Boykin and Willie Snead for a prominent offensive role in a low-volume Ravens' pass offense. He's unlikely to provide much fantasy production in a limited role this season."
105,Van Jefferson,Rams,WR,18.0,234.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The Rams selected Jefferson with a second-round pick in April's draft. Jefferson measures in at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds with good speed, hands (10 career drops on 268 targets) and route-running ability. The Florida product isn't particularly strong or explosive and struggled to do much with the ball in his hands while operating as a perimeter receiver at Florida. Jones is one of the oldest players in the 2020 draft (he'll turn 24 this summer), so he'll be expected to immediately provide competition to Josh Reynolds for No. 3 duties. He's unlikely to find his way to 2020 fantasy value, barring an injury to Robert Woods or Cooper Kupp, especially with Sean McVay turning to more multiple-tight-end sets down the stretch last season."

The former UMass star was active for 15 games as a rookie, but managed to get just 14 targets on 149 snaps. He made the most of the limited action with a 9-189-1 receiving line, but inexplicably didn't get a shot to play a larger role. Isabella will be hard-pressed for a Year 2 breakout after DeAndre Hopkins was added to a WR rotation that also includes Larry Fitzgerald and Christian Kirk. There's hope for Isabella down the road, but the 23-year-old shouldn't be drafted in single-season leagues."

The third-round pick was one of the biggest receivers in 2019 rookie class at 6-foot-5, 226 pounds. Despite his massive frame, Hurd was actually a running back who racked up 589 carries in three seasons at Tennessee before converting to slot receiver for one season at Baylor (48 carries, 107 targets in 2018). Hurd is obviously a very raw receiver, but his combination of versatility, athleticism and strength makes him an intriguing prospect. He'll need to beat out the likes of Trent Taylor, Kendrick Bourne and rookie Brandon Aiyuk behind Deebo Samuel, but Hurd is fine as a late flier in deep leagues."

Edwards can align all over the field and is an intriguing height/weight/speed prospect, though his shaky hands (22 career drops), route-running and separation skills are concerning. Edwards aligned in the slot 45% of the time and was primarily a short-area target in 2019 (8.2 aDOT), averaging a solid 2.6 YPRR. Henry Ruggs, Hunter Renfrow and Tyrell Williams lead the Raiders' depth chart, so Edwards will need to compete with that trio, as well as Nelson Agholor, Zay Jones and Lynn Bowden for rookie season reps.

Even when active, Lee was limited to only three receptions on 104 snaps in 2019. He finished in the top 35 among wideouts in targets in both 2016 and 2017, but had more drops (12) than touchdowns (6) during that span. Lee has never finished a season better than WR40 in fantasy and the likes of Julian Edelman, Mohamed Sanu, N'Keal Harry, Jakobi Meyers and Damiere Byrd offer plenty of competition.

Injuries above him on the depth chart should have positioned the 2019 second-round pick for a generous offensive workload, but instead he was held to 21 targets and a 10-169-1 receiving line on 463 snaps. Clearly not pleased with his progress, the Eagles drafted Jalen Reagor, John Hightower and Quez Watkins, while also acquiring Marquise Goodwin during draft weekend. Given that there's already Alshon Jeffery, DeSean Jackson and Greg Ward in the fold and Arcega-Whiteside has a very tough path to a second-year breakout.

Davis isn't particularly quick (4.59 short shuttle) and won't do much after the catch, but he could make some noise as a vertical threat off the bench in the pros.

Primarily a slot receiver (93% in 2019), Hill averaged an ugly 8.7 yards per target but caught 76% of balls thrown his way during his four seasons. Hill (6-foot, 196 pounds) has good hands (10 drops on 269 career targets) and is quality route runner but lacks speed (4.60 40-yard dash) and post-catch prowess. Hill is a long shot for 2020 fantasy value after plummeting to the seventh round, but the Chargers' depth chart is wide open behind Keenan Allen and Mike Williams. Monitor him in deep leagues."

179,Isaiah Hodgins,Bills,WR,3.0,35.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Buffalo drafted Hodgins in the sixth round of April's draft. The Oregon State product is a huge receiver with a 6-foot-4, 210-pound frame and 80.5-inch wingspan. His ball skills are outstanding, and he also has great hands (one drop on 123 targets in 2019) and contested catch ability. A lack of speed (4.61 40-yard dash) and strength (nine bench reps) are concerns, though he showed off his quickness with a wideout-best 4.12 short shuttle at the combine. Hodgins is a deep dynasty league stash with little 2020 fantasy appeal."

Proche is on the small side (5-foot-11, 201 pounds) and isn't particularly fast or quick, but he still managed big-time numbers at SMU, thanks to excellent ball skills, hands and production in contested situations. Proche's rate stats weren't great in 2019 (7.2 YPT, 4.1 RAC), but his 2.6 YPRR was solid and his 111 receptions tied for most in the FBS. Proche will look to carve out a role as a slot receiver and returner but is unlikely to find his way to fantasy value in 2020."
